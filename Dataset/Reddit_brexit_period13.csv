The government simply has to use the process rather than keep trying to re-run deal votes.

It just cannot be a year-long can-licking exercise, European governments are as sick of brexit as the man on the street. Yes, May is currently in a game of chicken with her own party, but playing it for another year would solve nothing. Itâ€™s unlikely the EU will grant anything more than a few months.Yesterday was something of a dress rehearsal for a â€œsaneâ€ majority to wrestle the issue from the government at the last minute, should nobody flinch in the silly brinkmanship between May and her ultraconservative mujaheddin (assuming the conflict is real and not staged; but looking at how May is ruining her health travelling back and forth, Iâ€™d say itâ€™s real). Today the government unleashed hell on the rebels, and still only survived a vote with a majority of 2. Labour too is starting to crack, with people resigning from the shadow cabinet so they can rebel against whips and vote with the government. Parliamentary arithmetic is now almost unpredictable on every single vote, but the successful ambush yesterday would indicate that stars will align when they really have to. The next moves depend on whether the extension is granted and on what basis: * If it is not granted, I would expect parliamentary fireworks on the week of the 25th.* If it is, a new soap opera will start around implementing the conditions that the government will inevitably have had to accept from the EU.

For starter, Bruxelles is all about pragmatic compromise rather than unflexible attitudes - itâ€™s the only way to shepherd agreement between dozens of member countries who donâ€™t even speak the same language. Despite all the propaganda to the contrary, very rarely there are â€œimpositionsâ€ in the EU, and more often than not they turn to dust anyway. This is a major strength and weakness at the same time, of the EU system as a whole: it guarantees everyoneâ€™s rights, but by doing so it often doesnâ€™t actually change anything.At this point, one month more or one less make little difference; what matters is whether the process is going forward or not, whether the agreement will be ratified or not. If the UK can come up with credible guarantees about making real progress towards a conclusion (like a plan to hold a vote), EU members will probably grant extensions and tweak rules, no problem.

197836,13,Ragnar234,"I guess it would be like Texas leaving the US. Not a direct comparison because the UK has far more documented history than Texas and is a nation with a national identity but in this context it may be useful. You're a Texan and believe that being part of the US is good for Texas. You benefit from federal funding, trade with the rest of the US without any friction etc. For 30 years though, the various state governors have blamed the federal government for all its failings in Texas and also bemoan the fact that other Americans can simply cross its borders and settle in Texas without controls. Those damn New Mexicans and Arizonians coming over here and taking Texan jobs for less money. The press is also split along these lines - the more populist media playing to that narrative that being part of the US is to blame for it all and that Texas has to fall in line with federal rules that are unfair and not in its interests. What is different of course is that Texas wouldn't have a generation of 60 and 70 year olds who remembered the Texas of their youths like the British - before the EU when everything was apparently better (it wasn't). One day, the to stave off an electoral challenge from an extremely popular Texan Independence candidate, a pro- federalist governor decides to call a referendum on independence,  believing that it would kill off the question for good and that there was no chance the independence cause would win. As such, no planning at all is done for a Texas outside of the US. We then have 2 years of lies in the campaign running up to that referendum. See https://www.google.com/amp/s/infacts.org/cut-keep-list-top-19-brexiteer-promises/amp/ for just a sample of them. On the other side, the government stupidly starts to panic and makes some really dire predictions and over exaggerations (called ""project fear"") about what happens if we leave which spectacularly backfires. It gets to the point where the 2 sides are so polarised, nothing the other side says is believed. The referendum is held and a shock result - Texas is out of the US. Now of course, it must negotiate how it gets out and the promises made start unravelling one by one. Texans were told that the US needed Texas more than Texas needed the US, yet the US is not budging in these negotiations. The promises made start looking like bullshit but so fanatical are the leave side that none of that matters- they voted to leave and so Texas must leave! The other side becomes more resentful - they now have to apply for a permit to travel to other states and lose all their rights outside of Texas. This split in the population is mirrored in the legislature and so we have the impasse we have today in the UK. Theresa May is tasked with delivering the undeliverable - a Brexit that satisfies the fanatical leave side that the remain side can live with. No such thing can ever exist. She has come up with a deal that both sides reject and has run the clock down in the hope that her deal is the only sensible choice because the other option is crashing out with no agreement on travel, trade, security or anything around the 40 years of integration we have had with the EU. So the deal has been voted down (twice) and now the can has been kicked down the road and we are not leaving the EU on the 29th of March but have delayed it 3 months. Of course, I have left out the most important issue about Brexit - Northern Ireland - as there is no equivalence here for Texas. Imagine Texas historically owned a piece of new Mexico and the population in that piece has split loyalties - some to Texas and some to New Mexico. For almost 100 years the 2 sides have fought because the New Mexican side believes this enclave should be United with the rest of New Mexico yet the other side wants to remain part of Texas. One day, an agreement is made to.end the fighting - there will be no border between New Mexico and the Texan owned part and the citizens within the Texan part can have dual citizenship- New Mexican and Texan and can come and go freely (see the Good Friday Agreement). Now however, with ""Texit"", all that changes. The Tecan part is pulled out of the US against its will (since in that part they all voted to stay in the US) and suddenly a border will be needed for trade between it and the rest of New Mexico. The politicians in Texas can see that this is likely to restart the troubles and claim that no border will be put in place but that won't work for international trade because it would mean zero tariffs for all countries trading Texas once it was outside of the US (WTO rules). So a ""backstop"" arrangement is agreed. Texan New Mexico will remain in the US free trade area for a limited time if Texas fails to agree a free trade deal with the rest of the US to avoid needing a customs border. The fanatics see this as a trap. It would either mean Texan New Mexico would be split from Texas and end up rejoining New Mexico or, to avoid breaking up Texas and Texan New Mexico, the whole of Texas would be part of that backstop. This would mean Texas wouldn't be free to go out into the world and negotiate it's own trade deals because it would still be bound by US rules on tariffs and other rules. And so that is the situation with Ireland and Northern Ireland -  NI citizens being osrt of the UK have dual citizenship and consider themselves Irish.

For them Brexit is somewhat of a relief, and they tend to argue that the Union needs to shed a few more passengers (mostly on the Eastern side).This said, they have always been something of a minority where it really matters. The truth is a pragmatic approach to compromise is what took the Union this far. Some members are there for money and trade, some for prestige and power on the world stage, some for security reasons... they all bring something to the table and contribute in making it the richest market on the planet. It's a delicate mechanism that is not really suited to harsh ideological stances.For this reason, I don't expect such hardened attitudes to appear at diplomatic level, particularly from countries with real skin in the game like France (Dover is also Calais, and UK-FR security integration is very advanced).

Official Scientology scriptures hold that the thetans (immortal spirits) of these aliens adhere to humans, causing spiritual harm.These events are known within Scientology as ""Incident II"", and the traumatic memories associated with them as ""The Wall of Fire"" or ""R6 implant"". The narrative of Xenu is part of Scientologist teachings about extraterrestrial civilizations and alien interventions in earthly events, collectively described as ""space opera"" by Hubbard.  Hubbard detailed the story in Operating Thetan level III (OT III) in 1967, warning that the ""R6 implant"" (past trauma) was ""calculated to kill (by pneumonia, etc.) anyone who attempts to solve it"".Within the Church of Scientology, the Xenu story is part of  the church's secret ""Advanced Technology"", considered a sacred and esoteric teaching, which is normally only revealed to members who have completed a lengthy sequence of courses costing large amounts of money.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",eikx5eq,eikx56e,b1d243,0.000261559,-0.999476881,Against,15-03-19

IRA members went to a number of addresses and killed or fatally wounded fifteen people: nine British Army officers, a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) officer, two members of the Auxiliary Division, two civilians, and another man who is believed to have been an intelligence agent.Later that afternoon, members of the Auxiliary Division and RIC opened fire on the crowd at a Gaelic football match in Croke Park, killing or fatally wounding fourteen civilians and wounding at least sixty others.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",eil2t0f,eil2srk,b1ds5x,0.911863817,0.823727634,Brexit,15-03-19

Why don't people understand that people like JRM, Farage, Murdoch, and Trump are narcissists or straight psychopath. I still don't get it why people don't see their dead eyes. They are a real danger, they orgenize via internet, and behind closed doors and want to rule the world, and its sadly no joke or conspirecy. What do you think Putin is doing? Read whats above and you know what he does. Trump is a wannebe part of this network like McConnell and Tucker. Putin, the Arabfamilies, UK elites, US big Money work together. https://www.amazon.com/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720 And plz don't buy the Book just wanted to show its in the open. So this nice guy is a MP of the UK parlaiment and he is an evil person. He wants cheap shoes and food for the workers, so he and his nazibrothers can revel in riches. He should explain why he gets money from russia, that little prick.[â€“]KittyGrewAMoustache It's insane to me that people don't see this, I mean, it's not even hidden. You look at the books Rees-Mogg wrote, then you look at what's happening in the world right now and it's obvious - these people aren't trying to liberate the people from some oppressive 'liberal' new world order, they're trying to liberate rich criminals and kleptocrats from national and international laws so that they can basically use their wealth to crush democracy and run countries and exploit workers for their own benefit. And it's so obvious. And yet all these people have been totally brainwashed into thinking Trump and Brexit are some kind of blow for the elites, or a fight back against neoliberalism or something, when actually they've been duped into supporting neofeudalism.Wtf that can't be true must be crazy.

None of your fault, it's like you say, the issue is far away and the news feeds on the topic are limited in the US.I think you tend to see the EU as something akin to NAFTA, just a complex trade agreement between many European states. In reality, the EU is a superstate entity that lies somewhere between something like NAFTA and something like the USA. Countries like the UK would like it to be purely NAFTA, while European Federalists would like it to become something like the USA, a real federation of states. The founding fathers of the EU were federalists, knowing that they would not see the project come to fruition in their lifetimes. Imagine that instead of the American Revolution, a federation is built over generations, bottom-up, one small act of integration at a time. We came a long way: a common currency, a common supreme court, a central bank, free movement inside the Schengen area for citizens and business, a Parliament, etc. Also the symbolic stuff, we have a flag and an hymn.Mostly, the UK would like the EU to be NAFTA (even many of the remainers). Federalism started after WWII, the dream of creating such a tight union that no other such war was possible. The founding fathers of the EU knew very well about the UK's stance on this, and famously De Gaulle was staunchly opposed to the UK joining. The EU progressed by creating all manners of exceptions, of which the UK enjoys many. They did not join the common currency, nor the Schengen area, not even the European Declaration of Human Rights. They had a lot of influence with much less skin in the game. As you can imagine, this is not very sustainable.So, to get to the answer: the EU is not negotiating the Withdrawal Agreement anymore. These are the terms of exit of the UK from the Union. We are now in a ""take it or leave it"" situation, May's government came to an agreement with the EU but the UK's House of Commons does not accept this agreement. The two year deadline set by Article 50 (that regulates how member states leave the union) is about to expire, nothing else is really happening in terms of negotiations.The big issue is Northern Ireland. Most of NI and the Republic of Ireland (a EU member state that, whose interests the EU is obliged to defend) do not desire the return of a border, that would likely rekindle violence between Irish unionists and nationalists, and between Irish nationalists and the UK itself. IRA stuff. So the big thing for the EU is that this border is avoided. The problem is that the UK wants to be out of a customs union and be able to negotiate its own trade agreements, so a border with the EU becomes unavoidable. The proposed solution (proposed by the UK government, in fact) is the famous ""backstop"". This is a measure to be triggered after the Withdrawal Agreement transition period, in case no other solution is found by then. The backstop is effectively a customs border at the Irish Sea, between NI and the rest of the UK. This would also keep NI under regulatory alignment with the EU. The ultra-orthodox Northern Ireland Unionist party, the DUP, hates the idea. They represent the view that NI should be part of the UK no matter what, and hate any sort of separation between them and the mother ship.Theresa May had the terrible idea of calling for elections not long after she became PM. She did not do so well, and was forced into a coalition with precisely the DUP to support her government. So the DUP now has a lot of power over the situation.Why doesn't the EU simply run down the clock and tell the UK to fuck off? Well, the UK has not applied to an extension yet, so nobody knows if the EU will not do exactly that. I think it won't, for the following reason: the UK is not magically be separated from us. It will still be our close neighbour, and the historical and geopolitical ties are strong after all. I do not think the EU is so worried about the economy, it is probably more worried about the future political situation. It desires to wash its hand off the situation, and not be seen as having contributed to the catastrophe that will undoubtedly unfold on the British side in case of no deal.The public opinion, at least in my bubble seems to be skewing more and more to: deal or no deal, don't care just leave. From the side of the EU patience is running thin. Brexit has hijacked our political agenda for more than two years, and we have other issues to worry about, e.g. the rise of far-right extremism in countries like Hungary, Poland and, to a degree Italy.So there you go: Europe is as weird and complex as it ever was :)",eilo4q3,b1h18z,b1h18z,0.015238856,-0.969522287,Against,15-03-19

198538,13,HumbrolUser,"Someone alluded recently to a situation in which the UK government might find itself out of order when the Brexit deadline comes 29. March, requiring a new prime minister as I understand it (or some similar chaotic situation), then what? Presumably, that might be an alternative way for UK running down the clock, leading to a hard Brexit as I understand it, passing 29. March.I am out of my comfort zone in commenting on this in particular, but as I happen to speculate that Theresa May is trying to run down the clock and going for a hard Brexit on 29. March; then, if the ERG MPs can be said to have some kind of way of sacking their own prime minister, then if true, I am tempted to think again that Brexit is an invention of the UK government. Perhaps one could imagine a plot if you will, that included from the very start, a bunch of conservative MPs, having majority in parliament, that wanted a Brexit, with a prime minister that somehow ends up with a perhaps odd backstop deal that was agreed on with the EU, which would lead to a with-deal-Brexit, but not the kind of Brexit her party wants.. so.. you get to run down the clock that way.. and as a trump card.. if there was a way for the prime ministers own coalition to sack her.. seems like a way to securely a run down of the clock for a hard Brexit to happen.Sadly, I feel dumb writing this, as I just don't have the know how to evaluate how silly or plausible such a scenario would be. I just know I don't trust the UK government (me not being British btw).I guess, maybe, if say any opposition MPs had an idea of sacking the prime minister, then now, it would be too late if leading to complications. Ofc, I have no idea what pros or cons would follow from a change in government.Then, perhaps Theresa May's position as the prime minister, in fronting her insistence of a third attempt at promoting a deal with the EU and UK's parliament, might as well be considered a ticking bomb of sorts, as the prime minister can (maybe) be sacked plausibly by own coalition if not doing what the coalition wants, but also, predictably, the prime minster can (maybe) be sacked plausibly by the opposition, or perhaps by the house speaker Bercow, if there is resistance to her 3rd attempt at a Brexit deal.Am I missing something here perhaps? As I said, I am not comfortable speculating this, when juggling with too many variables that I don't know enough about.What happens if house speaker Bercow, deny the prime minister the possibility of creating a motion for a vote on her 3rd deal?",eim5l43,b1jd8e,b1jd8e,0.000103722,-0.999792556,Against,15-03-19

People don't know what life outside the eu would look like, and as there was a democratic vote and decision followed by a general election in which the two parties with greatest number of votes each had manifesto promises to respect the referendum vote, putting another vote back to the people seems a ploy to subvert the vote under the guise of democracy by opportunistic remainers who want to benefit for the current chaos in parliament.Another consideration is how having such a vote would damage our bargaining power with the eu, hence again why in politics and economics you need to let things pan out. I agree that no one knows how a second in/out referendum would pan out, however, you could look to the most recent polls to see how weak the support for parties in favour of an in/out referendum seems to be.

The eu simply was and is not open to discussing restrictions on free movement. This manifested itself in increased support for ukip locally and ukip winning the largest proportion of votes in the uk mep elections. Following this, the tories, lib dems and ukip proposed referendums on eu membership in their 2015 manifestos and labour promised a stronger stance towards the union. The tories managed to win. I think it would have been preferential to be able to discuss problems and work out solutions and compromises with the eu, however, if items simply cannot be tabled for discussion then it's not surprising alternative parties promising reform start to receive support.

If you want my opinion on free movement of labour I think it has some very clear advantages and some very clear disadvantages. In terms of advantages:- it is great to live, travel and work in a number of countries without getting visas. - it is good for people to be able to find work in other countries if work in their own country is not available in the short term- it is good to promote better relations with neighbouring countries and build a stronger and more united continentIn terms of disdvantages:- due to the variances in average wages (romania's average wage being equivalent to 400 euros for example) free movement of labour can result in an exodus of skilled workers to countries where pay is better. This results in a skills shortage (or brain drain) and lack of growth for that country which has lost workers. This is highly damaging economically and has badly the growth and investment into italy, Spain,  romania and poland.- tying in with the above, the movement of people to countries where pay and working standards are higher, results in a depression of pay and working standards for that country.

199167,13,ElectronGuru,"Fellow American here. Itâ€™s useful to focus on the mechanics but the mechanics also need economic context...Many countries had self contained economies, with some people in charge, some people producing, and all people consuming. A mix of blue and white collar jobs. People could choose college or not and still support their families. Globalization came along and reorganized production to the cheapest countries, for all portable products. Some places (Germany/Japan) fought this and kept production local. Other places (US/UK) embraced this, reducing blue collar options (and power) for people without degrees. FFW a generation and the group losing income and power are pissed off. Other people (white collars) are benefiting from changes that are hurting blue collars. And people are now fighting to even get into colleges because while we doubled the need for office workers we didnâ€™t double the number of colleges. Into this void, in both countries is a political strategist who promises feelings of self determination. Who pretends to fix these economic problems by pointing fingers at political groups (DC/EU) and human groups (immigrants), says â€˜they are reason you feel like that, letâ€™s fight them togetherâ€™, and wins votes. But the political strategists arenâ€™t intending to actually solve problems. They just need enough votes to continue the economic changes that will reduce blue collar jobs and power even more. But by blaming others they are (were) able to generate the vote they needed to do it. I say were because after decades of this the people falling for the self determination promises are even more pissed and feeling even less listened to and ready to break the system they feel is responsible. Because if they arenâ€™t getting a piece of the pie, no one will get pie. Enter trump and Brexit. The voters are the same and the voters goals are the same. The difference comes down to whatever structure happens to be in place. USA had a land boarder so a wall will keep out the job stealing people. UK has a water channel so a brexit will keep out the job stealing people. But people didnâ€™t take their jobs so no action against them will fix it.

199201,13,toyg,"The UK government could have taken steps to remove the idea that people move here without a job. Free movement of labor is non-negotiable, but that doesnâ€™t mean everyone is free to move however they feel like. Places like the Netherlands have known this for quite some time, and have introduced brakes here and there. On the problems for countries that are sources of migration: they are grossly overstated. I am Italian, there are tons of Italians in UK and yes, I feel uneasy sometimes when I go to London and every hotel worker I meet is Italian. I know a lot of these kids have degrees and skills that are shockingly underutilised. But, itâ€™s nothing new: Italy has been a source of migrant labor for centuries. Italian labor helped to build the US, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, postwar Germany. My fellow *paisÃ * dug in the mines of Scotland and Belgium, and worked tables in France and Sweden. Some of what they made, they sent back so the country could survive - Southern Italy in particular is grossly overpopulated for the type of economic development that geography and modern technology would allow. Places that used to be the gateway of the known world are now irrelevant to modern trade routes, but there are still mouths to feed and history to preserve over there, so someone will have to get on his bike and provide. As for the brain drain, again itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s fault but ourselves: the Italian entrepreneurial class is anything but, stuck on pre-modern familistic models that donâ€™t promote on merit and refuse to invest on innovation, preferring the quick buck and competing on price. So people leave to fairer places (and sometimes find the grass  isnâ€™t always green, but hey). But a lot of people eventually go back, bringing with them a lot of professional experience and working practices that are slowly changing the place. Had they stuck to stupid jobs under stupid employers, this would not have happened. And I think you discount the beneficial aspect of membership for those countries: Romania for example now has centres of excellence in computing, â€œthe India of Europeâ€, and salaries are rising very very quickly. This would not have happened without EU membership. Same goes for the Czech Republic and Poland (which is now a world-leader for videogame development). On wage depression in advanced economies: yes, this *might* be true, it would make sense, but analysis after analysis has failed to find a clear link. And my experience is simply that the British just wonâ€™t bother even looking for certain jobs, regardless of wage. Anecdata: I donâ€™t like gardening, so for *four years*  Iâ€™ve tried to get someone to do it for me (I live in an ex-council semi-detached near Manchester, hardly Buckingham Palace). Iâ€™ve never once haggled on price or time, paid every time without complaining (I honestly donâ€™t care how it looks, as long as it doesnâ€™t get mistaken for a house from The Wire), and despite that, nobody has ever lasted more than a month or two. They just stopped showing up when they were supposed to. Friend of mine in another neighbourhood, got a Polish guy for *years* showing up like clockwork. Is this wage depression? What am I supposed to do, beyond paying what Iâ€™m asked to pay? Yes, itâ€™s anecdata, but it matches what researchers say. My ex-wife used to work in a brewery, their floor salaries where in the 25k already 15 years ago, union-protected and everything, and still they couldnâ€™t find workers whoâ€™d last more than a few months. In Lancashire, where mass-unemployment has been a fact of life for three generations! Modern brits will rather migrate to Australia or the US, rather than accepting a â€œlowâ€ job here, even if well-paid.

Yes, the European Community started as an economic cooperation, but its purpose has always been fueled by political and altruistic ideal of preventing future wars between the european nations. That goal alone is worth more than any and all economic gains that the EU has brought to its citizens. The British, however, never subscribed to that idea. They always held themselves above, joining the continental project because â€žthey need usâ€œ, even if the truth was different, as a way to gain something â€žfrom the peasants on the continentâ€œ without sacrificing anything in return. Brexit is a direct consequence of that and the very reason why the two sides speak past eachother, misunderstanding their every move.As long as the UK stays in the EU, it will always have someone to blame and will be robbed of the chance to reconcile with its past and the loss of the empire.

199367,13,MGBricks,"The EU is war-gaming for the fall of Theresa May amid a complete collapse in confidence in the prime minister after a week of chaos over Brexit, a leaked document seen by theÂ ObserverÂ reveals.In the run-up to a crucial summit of EU leaders where May will ask for a delay to Brexit, Brussels fears there is little hope that she will succeed in passing her deal this week and is preparing itself for a change of the guard in Downing Street.A diplomatic note of a meeting of EU ambassadors and senior officials reveals an attempt to ensure that any new prime minister cannot immediately unpick the withdrawal agreement should May be replaced in the months ahead. Some hardline Brexiters want to replace her with a leader who will back a harder split with Brussels.According to the minutes, the European commissionâ€™s secretary general, Martin Selmayr, who is known as a master of strategy, asked: â€œImagine that they have a new Brexit secretary or prime minister â€“ what then? Article 50 has been agreed and the process has ended. It must be clear that the starting point is not a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement.â€The moves in Brussels come before another critical and highly unpredictable week in the Brexit process in which May is expected to launch her third attempt to secure support for her beleaguered deal. TheÂ ObserverÂ understands that Labour will use the opportunity to offer its most strident support yet for a second referendum, by voting for a plan drawn up by two Labour backbenchers to put Mayâ€™s deal to a public vote.Cabinet ministers remained locked in talks this weekend with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist party, who are seen as vital in building a narrow majority for Mayâ€™s deal and who said on Saturday that there were â€œstill issues to be addressedâ€. And more Tory MPs currently opposing Mayâ€™s Brexit deal have told party whips they would back it if the prime minister announced she would quit this summer.The ebbing trust within her own party is matched by the mood in Brussels, where, according to the leaked notes, one diplomat said at the Friday meeting: â€œThe clear feeling is that there is a complete lack of confidence in the British prime minister to deliver on this deal.â€The document indicates Selmayr argued for a shorter Brexit delay than the three-month period currently being suggested. He warned that it risked leaving the EU paralysed if British MEPs were not elected in Mayâ€™s European parliament elections, but a new prime minister then revoked article 50 before July â€“ when the European parliament first sits. â€œWe should not run that risk,â€ he told the EUâ€™s member states on Friday evening.Selmayr further suggested that May would be asked to write into her letter of request for a delay that the UK would not interfere in long-term EU planning, such as the blocâ€™s budget, during the extra period of membership â€“ and that this should apply to her â€œsuccessorsâ€ in Downing Street.There were glimmers of hope for May yesterday as some Tory rebels, including Daniel Kawczynski, a member of the European Research Group of hardline Brexiters, revealed they were preparing to back the deal. Senior government sources said it was possible that May would refuse to hold a further meaningful vote on her deal should there be no chance of success. However, she is likely to hold it on Tuesday.DUP MPs and Tory Brexiters are being warned by whips that rejecting Mayâ€™s deal a third time will lead to a big delay and a softer Brexit, almost certainly including a permanent customs union with the EU. The prime minister warned on Saturday night that a lengthy delay requiring Britain to field candidates in Mayâ€™s EU parliament elections would be a â€œpotent symbol of parliamentâ€™s collective political failureâ€.Legal advice circulated at an EU meeting on Friday had seemingly opened the door to a Brexit delay until 1 July, when the new European parliament will sit for the first time. This would avoid the need for British MEPs to be elected in May.However, it has now emerged that Selmayr advised the ambassadors that in such a scenario a new incumbent in Downing Street could revoke article 50 in the period between May and July, leaving the UK as a member state but without MEPs. This would leave the EU â€œparalysedâ€ as its institutionâ€™s decision-making would be liable to legal challenge, the blocâ€™s legal experts warned.The meeting also heard concerns that the prime minister would be unable to offer a clear reason for an extension after what they regard as a likely defeat in the third meaningful vote.The EUâ€™s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said he â€œdoubtedâ€ that the prime minister would be able to offer such clarity in time for a summit in Brussels on Thursday, where the blocâ€™s heads of state and government will discuss their reaction. An extension of article 50 will require unanimous support from the 27 leaders.Selmayr also raised his doubts that May would be precise in her request, adding â€œshe never has been beforeâ€. He warned that â€œmeaningful vote three could become meaningful vote fourâ€ and go on indefinitely, but that repeated extensions were undesirable given the growing costs to businesses â€œeither side of the channelâ€.The French ambassador raised his concerns about the UKâ€™s role in the EU during the extension, and explicitly voiced Parisâ€™s doubts about the realism of a 21-month extension given that problem. Berlin said the EU should be as â€œflexibleâ€ as possible within the EUâ€™s red lines.This Saturday â€“ with less than a week to go before the UK is due to leave the EU â€“ hundreds of thousands of people are expected to join a march in favour of another public vote on Brexit. Michael Chessum, from the leftwing anti-Brexit movement Another Europe is Possible, said: â€œThe protest next weekend could be the biggest in British history. It will change the whole atmosphere around the Brexit debate, and bring huge pressure to bear on parliament. The Labour movement and the left are mobilising in a way they havenâ€™t before.â€ On Saturday a rival â€œMarch to Leaveâ€, which will arrive in London on 29 March set off from Sunderland.",eiozdno,b1yids,b1yids,1.73E-07,-0.999999655,Against,17-03-19

[Here is an article written by prominent Vote Leave campaigner and MEP Daniel Hannan.](http://archive.is/CDBFf) It gives a general gist of what the campaign was.""Terms were agreed easily enough. Britain withdrew from the EUâ€™s political structures and institutions, **but kept its tariff-free arrangements in place**. The rights of EU nationals living in the UK were confirmed, and various reciprocal deals on healthcare and the like remained.""""During the first 12 months after the vote, Britain confirmed with the various countries that have trade deals with the EU that the same deals would continue. It also used that time to agree much more liberal terms with those states which had run up against EU protectionism, including India, China and Australia.""""Unsurprisingly, several other European countries have opted to copy Britainâ€™s deal with the EU, based as it is upon a common market rather than a common government.""""The United Kingdom now leads a 22-state bloc that forms a free trade area with the EU, but remains outside its political structures.""What was sold was the idea that we remain within the single market but with none of the obligations. That was never on the table. He also paints this picture where the EU just bows down and gives us exactly what we want. That didn't happen either. He suggests that Wel will have trade deals with all 50-something countries we currently have deals with through the EU, plus ones with three more; I believe we actually have four in total right now, and we don't even have one with our largest reading partner.What was sold at the referendum, as captured in this now deleted blog post, is not what has actually happened.

Many people have come forward after not realising the exact implications. I mean even the ""hard brexiteers"" if you listen to them they are just regurgitating lies and believing them.I agree with another people's vote, for the following reasons:1. Democracy is all about being able to change our minds. 2. Referendums are only supposed to be advisory. There is no legal standing. If there were another one, parliament should use it as a guidepost to truly gage how people are feeling now, after 3 years of trying to sort. 3. It may well give some clarity and unity to parliament. 4. The original result was too close EITHER way. If it had been remain my opinion would be the same. 37% of the population and 52% of the electorate does not a majority make. My response to that would have been ""too close, make plans in the event of a leave decision then pitch to the public what we want to do.""The government fucked up. They did no real research on the leave campaign and spouted ridiculous facts with little basis. Remain were just as bad with project fear. But the real fuck up came in sitting on their hands for the better part of 2 years, not informing the people of the deal they had, pissing the brexiteers off by trying to get a deal and pissing the remainers off by leaving in the first place.

They controlled the ports and the coastal regions essentially a total choke hold on the country. The imperialists did what they wanted and because they had guns very little could stop them.China then allied with the USSR and was granted a gigantic loan from the USSR. The USSR then asked for it back a few years later when Mao did not like USSR meddling. They had no choice but to give it back well because the USSR had the most powerful military on their border.The USA then put a massive trade embargo on China lasting till Nixon.China became a sovereign power 16 October 1964 with their first nuclear test as there was no longer the fear of a USSR/US invasion.The Chinese government was free to do anything it wanted. They made a LOT of mistakes for 2 decades until Deng came into power.So what's the difference? China was FORCED to do what foreign powers wanted them to do. There was little to no negotiation whatsoever it was give me your shit or DIE!!!So does this apply to the EU and UK? Not really as the EU does not have gunboats enforcing its law in the Thames.

The question, in my opinion, should not be wheter to leave or remain, rather whether to leave with the agreement negotiated or without a deal entirely.The EU has made clear that no other deal is available, therefore claims that there are going to be more negotiations and renegotiations would be disingenious. Consequently I think asking the people whether to take it or leave it, is a legitimate proposition.The outcome will be ugly either way.

But EU kept completely unified. Not all EU countries are affected in the same way by Brexit, and some countries are more powerful than others. But Germany remained in complete solidarity with Ireland. And so did smaller countries on our eastern border, who have very little trade with the UK. The leavers wanted this to shatter. They wanted to make a deal with Germany, the Netherlands, France. And then have them dictate everything else to the rest of Europe. They believed the EU was about to fall apart.

But in no country it is worse than in the UK.The main reason we have the EU is to make sure we don't have any more wars. Even ignoring WWI and WWII, Europe has seen some terrible wars. We had to find a way to end it. The answer was the form the EU. The huge economic benefit is just the icing on the cake.The UK look back at WWII with a lot of romanticism because almost no one alive today lived through it. And while the UK lost what remained of their empire because of WWII (they basically lost the war), they were never occupied. So while they should have felt humiliated, like almost every other European country, they didn't. They don't get occupied because they are an island. So they do not fear war.&amp;#x200B;British politics is dominated by the English aristocrats. These are people who come from families who have ruled the British Empire for generations. Now finally their turn has come, and there is not much left to rule. Their fore-bearers ruled the entire world or beat Hitler. And all that is available to them is being humiliated by having to listen what Slovakia has to say about the future of the EU.  All these people are educated in private schools, but the education they receive is actually no longer better than the education available to everyone else. This creates a ruling class that has a delusional world view, a delusional self-image, a complete lack of ability to relate to their EU counterparts. England is imploding on itself. And the people that rule is want to will it to be a global empire once again. And there is such a big gap between their view and reality. And this is what caused Brexit.&amp;#x200B;As for the ordinary voter, it seems that racism is one of the major reason of Brexit voters.

I wasn't alive when we joined the EEC but when the maastricht treaty was signed in 92 and we joined the EU that's when the UK went downhill when non-workers could freely move from country to country and border control greatly reduced. Illegal immigrant really just means you can legally stay if you sneak in and marry a brit, terrorism in our country is always caused by a non-eu citizen , i mean we were even debating wether to let a woman back in to the UK after she'd gone home to join ISIS in Syria (non-EU).

She's a political black hole because nothing, not even light, can escape. Ideas, beliefs, suggestions, objections, inquiries, proposals, projects, loyalties, affections, trust, whole careers, real men and women, are sucked into the awful void that is Downing Street â€” and nothing ever comes out: no answers, only a blank so blank that it screams.

Because the positive effects of cooperation, even within the EU's rather slow and bureaucratic framework, are real and substantial. Because every single Brexit scenario, even the softest one, is going to leave the vast majority of people strictly worse off than remaining within the EU. Because Brexit, for all the talk about sovereignty and taking back control, will do no such thing: the UK government will have less power and less room to maneuver outside than as a leading member of the EU. Because most of the things people blamed the EU for, are either fabrications (to the point that the EU council has to set up whole websites dedicated to debunking them) or policies supported and endorsed by successive UK governments, meaning Brexit will not 'fix' them.And because the whole problem (the EU) was a lie, the solution will not actually make anything better. This is a problem because:- the politicians who made their careers supporting Brexit can't admit that (because doing so would invalidate most of their stances). So they must change the goalposts and say that this type of Brexit is not the one that will deliver the magical solution. Neither can they take control of the Brexit process itself, because they they would be in charge of delivering something that is impossible and take the blame if it fails. They are thus determined to stay at the sidelines, shouting, so as to maximize political gain without taking any responsibility.- the politicians who are not especially married to Brexit or the EU (probably the majority). They could obviously see that was is a bad idea, no matter the ""flavour"" of  Brexit chosen. If they act on that, they will lose the support of the pro-Brexit voters. If they support Brexit they will be blamed for its eventual consequences. If they do neither, voting down every deal but not taking charge of the process themselves (either through ousting the government or forcing its hand), they can try to wash their hands of the whole thing and blame it on the current government ministers.- the UK government has actually tried (and failed) to get the fairy-tale deal that the Brexit campaign promised. It knows that it has not enough support to get the Brexit deal through parliament. The only possible strategy is blackmailing parliament: force it to choose between the deal and the absolute worst outcome, with as little time as possible before the deadline.For all groups, inaction is the preferred strategy. The only problem is that Brexit has a deadline, which forces them to come to a decision, one way or another. It makes sense, in their situation as described above, to delay taking decisions as long as possible, even though this strategy has extremely damaging effects to the UK as a whole (beyond the normal negative effects of Brexit).",eircudu,b27uqy,b27uqy,0.003272157,-0.993455686,Against,17-03-19

But more than that - the problem that May has isn't really about the time constraints, it's about Parliamentary arithmetic. If Article 50 still hadn't been invoked to this day then still the ERG would vote down a compromise deal like this, still Labour would oppose it for the sake of opposing it, the Lib Dems would oppose it because they don't accept the result of the referendum and the SNP would use it as another wedge to push the cause of Scottish independence.

So bear with me: the liberals (who are completely pro-remain) cannot get anyone to vote  for  them. This  is because they abandoned all principles to form a coalition with the anti-christ (conservatives).  the labour party are included in the media as brexit decision makers even though there is 100% nothing they can do as they arent in power. Interesting that their  leader has a WORSE rating than May right now. Their  natural support is annoyed with them because many of them wish to remain and they cannot  see why the  labour leader has been pretty much forced into the decisions he has made.     And  because in an ACTUAL LEGALLY BINDING referendum the UK voted against the alternative vote, none of the other political parties  matter.    So from three parties:   Libs - unlikely to ever recapture any power in the next decade.  Labour - demonised by the press,  and  with a divided support base.  Cons - absolute bastards, but likely victors of this whole mess.    Its a simple case of divide and conquer. You have families,  friends, colleagues, who will never talk to each other again because of the brexit vote. You have significantly divided opponents who struggle to get into power at best of times. You have a populace  that dont understand enough about voting to see how a PR vote and a coalition government can be a great  thing.      The NHS will get sold off. Conditions for the poorest  will  get worse (3000  a day access food banks in the UK  right now). No one will knock the conservatives out of  power because the UK populace will be arguing about brexit for the rest of their lives.   Think this is overly pessimistic tinfoil-hattery?  The original march to London from Jarrow was dirt poor, starving people from the north marching for jobs and better lives. They put their heads down and GROUND the fuck out of 300 miles to make a point.

Then, theoretically, your marriage will be valid in Germany, but in practise the German bureaucracy will require a document from a German Standesamt. The Standesamt, in turn, will typically require a certified German translation of your marriage certificate plus additional documents verifying the authenticity of your marriage certificate, such an apostille. Details depend on where you got married.   As a non-EU spouse of a German citizen, you then need to request an ""Aufenthaltserlaubnis"".

The issue is IMHO made a lot worse because the UK has only two major parties and during most of this period the leadership of both seemed only interested in ""weaponizing"" Brexit for political gain (though the party now in government is obviously more to blame here).Where I live, people are increasingly looking at Brexit, not as a strategic change of direction by the UK, but rather as a conflict within the UK's conservative party that has been externalized through the referendum and the subsequent political maneuvering. Framing it that way is one way to explain the strangely uncoordinated strategy the UK government employed throughout the negotiations. The perception is that the UK government did not know what it wanted once the more unrealistic demands of the first few months (that would have led to the collapse of the common market or the EU itself if accepted) were removed from the table. IMHO the UK government is lucky to be negotiating with the EU, which has a lot of interests in common with it and, in the end, wants to minimize the damage of Brexit to itself or the UK. Other entities (third countries when trade deals are discussed) might have a lot less scruples about profiting from confusion and political insecurity at the other end of the negotiating table. There's still a very good chance that the negotiations will ultimately fail, but even then the UK government has the luxury of de facto choosing the default outcome: no-deal or cancelling article 50.",eirod9n,eirljkw,b27uqy,7.87E-05,-0.99984258,Against,18-03-19

200219,13,Ground-Rat,"Thanks for your response!I beg to differ on the under control point, and yes they have already caused permanent damage.But I do agree, and I thought I had expressed that at this moment the Brexit issue is more pressing, real and likely damaging than what's going on here.I agree with everything else you have to say, everyone (UK MPs) seems to be living in some kind of fantasy world, where all they have to do is take some more non-binding votes and somehow everything's going to be ok.A no-deal Brexit is going to be ugly, and I agree that no one really knows just how bad it could get.  I suspect that the UK will bear a larger burden and take more damage than the EU as a whole, but regardless a no-deal is likely going to be a real disaster, unless the EU decides to unilaterally take action to minimize the impact damage, by essentially breaking a bunch of rules.Shame on the Leave MPs for not having and offering a workable plan during the Leave campaign, shame on the people who voted for Leave without considering the potential outcome, or for believing the ""too good to be true promises"" made by the Leave campaigners as well as gov't leaders (Yeah I'm looking at you Mr. Johnson).Shame on the Remain campaign folks and the Remain Gov't leaders for not taking the Leave campaign seriously and not getting the information on the possible and likely consequences of Leaving the EU.Shame on the Remain folks who didn't take the time to go out and vote, because they ""figured"" Leave had no chance of winning.I personally suspect that the EU has a far better idea than the UK has on the likely outcome of a no-deal, and that's why they have been bending over backwards to try to get a deal settled.The however can only bend so far, in order to keep leaving the EU something that is worse than joining and later leaving.The forest will survive and likely come back even better and stronger that it was, but the individuals who lit the fire, who knows, they may get away unscahted or they might burn to death, but if the thought is that they will ""survive"" then that's just more motivation to light a fire that they ""know"" is probably not a good idea, because they really want to see what happens.In both the UK and the USA, the powers that be, failed to recognize the anger felt by those who were feeling disenfranchised and forgotten, and they were all suckered by the promises of riches and the ability to go back to the way it was before the EU and globalization ""affected"" them.They were suckered, and the sad thing is when all is said and done they will likely be the most affected by Brexit and the Trump presidency.I didn't at any time mean to imply that our problem was bigger than your problem, I'm pretty sure that I said something about currently watching your problems because they are more interesting and the final result and impact will probably be seen sooner than later.I've been watching less and less TV lately, due to becoming tired of all the drama, I still read the news.I just learned today that Rudy's last TV appearance was 20 Jan, and here I was just thinking that I just was ""missing"" my favorite crazy ""uncle"" character who was an ex-federal prosecutor and is a lawyer, spout his utterly insane drabble on the TV.  I'm not sure if I had included the ""Mic drop"" thing in my earlier reply, that was an attempt at humor/satire because it does look to me as if the PM is trying to do her damndest to get some kind of deal put together, only to be blocked and foiled by the MPs at every step.I think a no-deal will really suck, and it will make everyone wish that they had accepted any deal...  I hope that the EU does grant an extension, and that the MPs will not squander that time, and get some kind of deal passed.I also think that revoking Article 50 is also a viable plan, and maybe even a wise thing to do considering the level of dysfunction being demonstrated by the MPs and their parties.But that would be political suicide for the ruling party, but then sometimes you just have to fall on your own sword, when it comes to the good of the country and/or nation.Yep the no-deal is the default in a little under two weeks, if nothing is done...

Around 200 men (or ""Crusaders"" as they preferred to be referred to) marched from Jarrow to London, carrying a petition to the British government requesting the re-establishment of industry in the town following the closure in 1934 of its main employer, Palmer's shipyard. The petition was received by the House of Commons but not debated, and the march produced few immediate results. The Jarrovians went home believing that they had failed.""  ""Despite the initial sense of failure among the marchers, in subsequent years, the Jarrow March became recognised by historians as a defining event of the 1930s. It helped to foster the change in attitudes which prepared the way to social reform measures after the Second World War, which their proponents thought would improve working conditions. The town holds numerous memorials to the march. Re-enactments celebrated the 50th and 75th anniversaries, in both cases invoking the ""spirit of Jarrow"" in their campaigns against unemployment. In contrast to the Labour Party's coldness in 1936, the post-war party leadership adopted the march as a metaphor for governmental callousness and working-class fortitude.""    I live near by.

200395,13,barryvm,"Very well, I will do so. I don't know why you're getting down voted for asking me to clarify my post.Both the EU and the UK have little to no room for compromise on this issue, for obvious reasons. The Good Friday Agreement and the subsequent political negotiations prohibit the (re)institution of a hard border around NI. At the same time, the treaties that govern the common market forces member states to institute border checks (a hard border) on all external borders of the EU customs zone. It is easy to see why: the rules of the common market, decided by the EU and its members, would be worthless if you can simply circumvent them by importing non-compliant goods over an unguarded border. Note that even a normal free trade agreement is not enough: the EU (and the UK) will still need to check the goods that are imported to see whether they are up to regulations. The only type of FTA that would keep the border open is one that binds the UK to uphold all EU regulations, which should be completely unacceptable to every Brexit supporter. At the same time, the Republic of Ireland is also a signatory of the GFA and has the power to shut down any Withdrawal Agreement that would lead to a border around NI. So the EU can't sign such a deal, even if it wanted to (and has made it clear that it won't from the very beginning). The UK situation is different: for them Brexit should increase UK independence from the EU, which is why they have, from the very beginning, pushed for a Brexit without regulatory compliance to EU rules. This would force the EU (and the UK, for that matter) to put border checks in NI, unless it leaves NI in the customs border. This is politically dangerous, because unionists in NI are opposed to this, fearing that this would loosen the bond NI has with the rest of the UK and that it would lead to Irish unification (and they are probably right). The backstop (a proposal from the UK government, which the EU agreed to as a concession) was meant to delay solving the Irish border issue until after Brexit. The gambit didn't really work because the unionists feared that the UK government would sell them down the river and leave NI in the customs union to get the Brexit they want as soon as it became politically possible to do so (and once again, they are probably right).It is perfectly possible for the UK to have all these things, but that means it will no longer comply to the EU common market rules. Hence, it must leave the common market and the customs zone. In the first phase of the negotiations the UK government attempted to keep access to the common market without following all the rules (e.g. freedom of movement). This is something the EU cannot accept because that would open it up to to unfair competition from companies in (or trading through) the UK and a massive loss of agency (it wouldn't be able to enforce its own regulations if you could ignore them simply by moving to the UK). Accepting the UK government's proposals would have lead to the destruction of the common market and (probably) the political disintegration of the Union. Because of this a ""soft"" meaningful Brexit is impossible. A hard Brexit (which the UK government is now working towards), however, is equally problematic, because the UK's previous commitments to the GFA (as outlined in the previous point).",eishxuf,eisbz7l,b27uqy,0.002756796,-0.994486407,Against,18-03-19

You seem to believe that you made a decision to have UK leave the EU, as if you could be the one that actually decided such a thing, this is clearly not how your democracy works when Parliament was always known to facilitate any Brexit and any vote on it, in the first place.OP did not use the word 'democracy' here, and I won't either, but as for the problem of how the prime minister can try get a vote on a Brexit deal for the third time, and maybe even a fourth, if you can call this vote for a deal in parliament a ""decision"", it still wouldn't be the same as your idea of a ""decision"" by voting in the referendum. Both notions, the voting in the referendum, and voting in parliament, are both ""decisions"" on a metaphorical level, and thus can't be the same 'decision' that would actually be a 'decision'.As I argued previously in this sub-reddit, Theresa May was basically saying something inherently untruthful, and she must had known it, when she said that the voters had made 'a decision' on Brexit. Treating the notion of a  'decision' on the level of metaphors, would never be the same as the more formal understanding of there being a 'decision'. having Theresa May also calling something 'a decision' in name only, doesn't make it true.",eiskv0x,b2gvr8,b2gvr8,2.53E-05,-0.999949403,Against,18-03-19

However, I'm baffled that they ever entertained the notion that they could force concessions on the EU that would almost certainly destroy it (e.g. picking and choosing rules and single market access, agreeing to a hard border in Ireland). I'm from Belgium myself, and I distinctly remember a professor predicting this whole mess (UK forced to leave the common market because of its stance on immigration and regulation, leading to trouble about Northern Ireland) the morning after the referendum, so the UK government should have seen this coming as well.My thinking is that most of the Brexit negotiations were there for ""internal consumption"": they were a show put up for the own electorate, not a set of achievable, seriously considered goals. For a UK politician, the UK is the centre of the world because that's where his/her career is decided upon. The voters, parties and the internal party struggles are more important to them while the EU, and the UK's place in or out of it, is of secondary concern.

200673,13,Paul_Heiland,"I'll happily go further than that and explain **WHAT** we don't understand: The Withdrawal Agreement (AKA ""Theresa May's Agreement"") is intended as a STOPGAP whilst the UK and the EU negotiate the architecture of their future trading relationship. It is time-limited to December 2020 with an extension clause until December 2022. There is an insurance clause that notwithstanding, the NI border will remain open and because insurance risks don't generally die a death overnight, this clause is not time-limited to December 2020/2022. The agreement honours the fact that the UK is from 29. March 2019 no longer bound to EU due process.IN FACT, the two years forseen in the treaty for the leaving process are intended for the ENTIRE terminal package of Withdrawal + Future Relationship. The UK has spanned this period out such as to make only the former (briefer) part possible. Michel Barnier issued urgent time warnings every two months, to little avail. The UK dragged its feet heavily. At the end of the *total package timeframe*, not even the Withdrawal part has been finalised on the part of the UK.My urgent question: Where is the difficulty in finalising an agreement (WA) which spans a mere TWO YEARS, two years which BTW are an extension on the contractual two year completion timeframe? In two years, the final agreement could (theoretically) look quite different, the UK is committed by the WA to nothing! It seems now that the UK wants to extend membership - this is exactly what would have been provided by the WA, but without the restrictions of full membership!From our (EU) view, the UK is making an unscalable mountain out of the molehill WA.

Moreover, the president's new budget reinforces this.

The Remain side was lazy and thought the public would understand how incredibly of a bad idea this would be. The pro-Brexit side never thought they would win, so they felt free to sell any random bullshit they wanted to the public. And then Brexit won, 52/48.So, Cameron decided he wanted nothing to do with this mess, and bailed. And then the pro-brexit side saw the clusterfuck that was this turning into, and also bailed. They wanted to rule, but they didn't want to be responsible for dealing with a mess like this.The job fell to Theresa May. Who made a grievous error: trying to consolidate her power she called for new elections and instead reduced it.Now the UK is stuck in a situation where the public voted close to 50/50 (so there will be a lot of unhappy people no matter what), were promised something that can't be realized, no party has a majority rule, everyone hates each other, and there's the GFA issue in the mix.No party holds a dominant enough position to force their point of view, the whole referendum was a horrible idea from the start, and far too many people are thinking of their own careers rather than the country's wellbeing.",eitcdvu,eit00tk,b2i4mq,0.040599047,-0.918801906,Against,18-03-19

His stated objective is to take the UK out of the EU in a Hard Brexit/No Deal scenario which will play nicely into his (and likely his supporters/enablers) hands. Almost certainly his hedge fund (recently moved from the UK into Ireland to ensure continued EU financial market access) will benefit from the many ways to make a large amount of money when an economy the size of the UK collapses.So why do people like and follow him? Well, he is always extremely well presented. Never a hair out of place with a consistent look and style. He exudes confidence and authority. With his smooth, hypnotic voice he presents a very polished debating style so that even a seasoned critical thinker like James O'Brien has a difficult time getting either a rise or a concession out of him. To mere mortals he is a very powerful figurehead and unfortunately the UK still has remnants of respect for unearned authority - such as the aristocracy, the ""leaders who are born to rule.""

201103,13,Leetenghui,"In the UK you have freehold. This means you own title to the land your house sits on (only down to a couple of metres) and the sky above (again only a few metres above). As a freeholder you can own the property and land forever eminent domain/compulsory purchase aside. In short you own your own house/home.You pay Â£150,000 for your house then that's your total obligation.The opposite of this is leasehold. Leasehold is effectively renting. So that same Â£150,000 house? Oh that's not for the house. It's RENT. So you pay say 25 years rent UP FRONT. At the end of the 25 years the house and land revert back to the freeholder. As a result you get people *buying* Â£200,000 houses with 12 years left and nobody wants to *buy* them. A leasehold also comes with a ground rent each year that IIRC is being used to milk leaseholders. So in addition to paying rent up front ? You STILL have to pay ground rent and maintenance rent each year.That's bad right?Not quite. It depends entirely on who owns the lease. Your private freeholder will milk you to death he or she has nothing to lose. You can't pay the ground rent? You get booted out he gets to sell it again.Many new homes are also leasehold with an offer to buy the lease after a year or so. Many refuse and they get turned into milk cows because they don't realise the effect on it.But post WW2 it was common for council houses to be leasehold with council freeholders. In towns like Bolton 90% of the property is leasehold. The leases are 999 years and you pay a peppercorn in rent (pennies). So it's effectively freehold.Everything in the UK is technically leasehold as everything is owned by the crown EVERYTHING. So really it depends on who has the right to the title. The queen owns everything but lets you use it in return for taxes. So you either become the freeholder or the leaseholder.Also communist countries like the USSR and China everything is leasehold. Everything in Hong Kong is leasehold to 2047 when the border between HK and China is taken down. Everything in China has a 70 year lease max. Typical apartments are 20 years this is because the life expectancy of apartments is no more than 25 years. The precedents were set in 2017 when leases were simply renewed for a peppercorn amount in Wenzhou and you get another 25 years. ",eituyzc,eitkiqb,b2kx1t,1,1,Brexit,18-03-19

He has however become one of the most outspoken Brexiteers and has planted himself on radio station phone ins and pops up everywhere as if he were a cabinet minister and not just the MP for NE Somerset. He is a great metaphor for one of the greatest lies of Brexit - that it is somehow the working class rebelling against the elite. JRM is the elite. He leads his brain dead lemmings like a pied piper promising them unicorns while they are oblivious to the harder times that await. JRM will be fine though, incorporating his company in Eire to access the EU market and living off his massive wealth. Like a posher version of Farage, JRM is a man of only superficial substance. Delve a little deeper like James O Brien did recently and you'll find that behind the authoritative demeanour and complex lexicon, he knows very little. This was exposed when On Brien pressed him on WTO terms. JRM has promised the lemmings cheaper food and goods whilst we are out of the protectionist EU. He didn't of course check that out with Gove who is talking about tariffs on agricultural imports. Neither did he consider that having no trade border with the whole world means that we cannot raise tariffs on anyone due to the preferential country rule under WTO. Moreover, when asked how we would monitor and check that foodstuffs would meet UK standards without a border and whilst being out of the single market, his response was that we would.have to trust the exporters. The example given was Australian beef which he would be perfectly happy to eat - if it was good enough for Australians it was good enough for us. No doubt but this logic would have to apply to all imports. Scratching just beneath the surface Mogg was exposed as another charlatan with only half an idea of what he was arguing with which to augment his personal crusade.

It turns out that the former secretary general of the UN did not say what was put in the quotes. What apparently happened, was that the two journalists, had copy pasted a political opinion into a quotation, making it a paraphrase at best, but still false. Instead of the two journalists translating this one single word, straight over to norwegian, they inserted a political opinion that the secretary general of the UN clearly never made. Presumably a piece of local propaganda, towards some foreign country which I don't remember.

(Not least because he goes out of his way to obfuscate the bad news).As a case in point;  This is a clip of JRM debating with James O'Brien, a radio personality...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF3OQkWEyZAIn it, JOB backs JRM into a corner and forces him to admit that he's going to welcome in beef from Australia which is subject to much lower food standards than we currently enjoy (eg they allow hormone injections).If you read through the comments, many Brexiteers believe he ""Put JOB in his place"".Yet these are all reasonable people and if you pressed them on any particular point, they'd eventually agree with you (after much squirming), but as promise after promise has proven to be a lie, the only way they can defend their initiald decision is to move to the extremes.Anecdotally, I've started hearing Brexiteers claim that this is all being done ""To show the Germans they can't boss us around"".

As in, whatever process it takes to make laws ie. the Houses of Parliament it needs to go through,  and approved by the Queen etc, maybe cannot be done in time. If there is not enough time for May's Deal to go through even if it were to voted through right now (as I think Philip Hammond said recently) how is there time for a new law to pass about an extension? Could it even be deliberately delayed in order to stall for time in the hope of a No Deal brexit? Can a law be passed through this fast? Doesn't the European parliament also need to a approve the deal too? Etc.

Juncker warned to 'think carefully' or RISK Brexit catalyst across EU"".&amp;#x200B;Not too long ago, I wrote a reply to a Reddit thread that asked the question, **what word would you remove?** (Note: Nevermind the likely problem/controversy of actually trying to remove a word from language, that isn't important.)This below, is based on what I wrote in reply in the Ask Reddit sub-reddit, and I thought it would be relevant here in this sub-reddit:&amp;#x200B;'Hate'It seems all too clear to me, that people are typically unable to discuss certain things when it comes to using the word 'hate' in an argument, without ending up dumbing things way down; such that their opinions no longer makes much sense. By insisting that some people ""hate"" something, or somebody, they paradoxically claim to know about somebody's intent when attributing ill will to other people (the act of referring to other people 'hating' stuff), while also failing to rationally explain why they ""hate"" something or somebody beyond having an ill will towards others, or something. It is as if 'hate' is this word people use as a label to support their ignorance and perhaps anger, while 'hate' imo would only make sense insofar as you or others are actually attributing 'hatred' onto others but in concrete ways that is knowable as a given problem that can be understood.So.. if you in believing that other people ""hate"" you, that you believe they do this because they are angry, is dumb and is probably very wrong, as it is sensible to think there must be a good reason for why people would be angry in the first place.Then.. when you yourself tell others that you hate somebody or something, if you don't already have a good idea as to why, you are just a complete fucking idiot. And if you aren't really angry, you are just seemingly an opinionated person, or worse, just a complete fucking idiot when you don't even know why you willingly seem to express ill will towards something, or somebody.Anyone that dabble with a word like 'hate' likely require a reality check I would think, especially if what they talk about doesn't makes any sense beyond the obvious rhetoric ploy of pretending to be upset.&amp;#x200B;",NA,NA,b2jloa,0.000510412,-0.998979176,Against,18-03-19

Here's a genuine question for those saying we should leave with no deal.IMHO, no deal has never been an option and quite simply cannot be an option at this day and age. This is obvious and politicians are fully aware of it, but they pretend they are considering it anyway, to please the masses.The problem is the lack of laws and legislation we currently have that the government failed to put in place a replacement for.Imagine you are a customs official. We leave with no deal and you turn up for work the next day. Since there is no deal, legislation for import/export of goods, immigration and several other things could not be put in place. So what do you do? Clearly you cannot just carry on like the day before, when we were still in the EU. This means a complete halt to all export/import which AFAIK everybody agrees can not possibly happen. (you have to import replacement parts for machines, medicine, some food, etc...)Many laws and legislation used on a daily basis in the UK come from the EU. There are no UK equivalent for these. So what rules are we supposed to abide by once we've left? Go back to the time before we joined the EU? Clearly those laws would be inadequate today.Since there are only a few days left, there is zero chance that the necessary legislation can be put in place in time.So how exactly could a no deal possibly go down in your opinion?",NA,NA,b2mthi,0.395980417,-0.208039167,Neutral,18-03-19

The steady destruction of the social state under subsequent regimes continued post-Thatcher (slowed a bit under New Labour) and meant that when austerity hit in 2008 there was no fat left to trim.

Keeping a level of control over the island of Ireland is a geostrategic imperative for Oceania (as well as the UK in real life, since our world has identical geography) to maintain geographic security of the big island.

So they'd be pretty relieved to be rid of it.Of course, this is all assuming that Winstons assumptions about the state of the world and O'Brian's claims on it are correct. Since citizens in England are cut of from communication with the rest of the world, even with the rest of Oceania, and all information is party controlled, for all we know maybe it's just the former UK run by a Turbo-UKIP like party that fires a few ICBMs at her own territory every now and then to keep the citizens on their toes.

To dogmatically stick to the result of a vote taken over two years ago when things have changed so much is ridiculous.2. The original referendum never had a choice of how we would leave. This has directly caused the problem right now where MPs are deadlocked arguing over what to do next. A referendum would give an unequivocal direction for MPs to follow.3. Having a final vote is equivalent to what other countries do. For example, the Swiss would normally have an indicative referendum first (like we did) after which the government goes away to research and negotiate the details. There is then the binding referendum on whether to proceed now that everyone knows what the deal looks like. It makes absolute sense and it seems weird that we wouldn't want to do this properly, instead just relying on an indicative vote.4. In theory there are just two choices open to Parliament. Either rescind our notification under Article 50, or have another referendum. Parliament has already rejected the deal that was negotiated twice. They've also said that they do not want the country to leave with no deal. The EU have said they will not reopen the deal, but would allow an extension for a referendum.

There'd likely be MPs responding to the broader constitutional question on the power of the Speaker over Parliament's business. Look at the motion that was passed last Thursday, for instance. That lays out conditions and contingencies for what the government will do if a 3rd vote on May's deal passes or fails. Passing a motion (with over 400 votes) on what you'll do after MV3 does rather imply Parliament was expecting there'd be a MV3, and the wording of the motion indicates it would be on the same withdrawal agreement and future relationship declaration. If Parliament has already implicitly agreed to an MV3 on unchanged terms, it may be a significant overstep for the Speaker to then frustrate the will of Parliament in that regard.

And this week will see a possible third rejection of Theresa Mayâ€™s Brexit deal by the House of Commons.â€œHe wakes me up every morning meowing to death because he wants to go out, and then when I open the door he stays put, undecided, and then glares at me when I put him out,â€ Ms Loiseau said.Ms Loiseau is set to be the top candidate for Emmanuel Macronâ€™s party in the upcoming European Parliament elections, where she will go head-to-head with Marine Le Pen, who is hoping to lead a far-right insurgency.Watch moreThe minister has taken a tough and sometimes provocative line in Brexit negotiations so far, proactively shooting down UK proposals and warning of the risks of a no-deal Brexit.In October she controversially suggested that a no-deal Brexit would be better than Theresa Mayâ€™s Chequers proposals for the EU, taunting the prime minister her own phrase: â€œNo deal would be better than a bad dealâ€.Her approach has echoed the tone set by her president Emmanuel Macron, who has warned he could block an Article 50 extension if the UK does not come up with new choices to justify it.The EUâ€™s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has taken a minister tone, asking: â€œWhy would we extend these discussions? The discussion on Article 50, that is done and dusted. We have the withdrawal agreement, it is there. That is the question asked and we are waiting for the answer to that.â€Ms Loiseau has steered emergency legislation through the French national assembly to give the countryâ€™s government sweeping executive powers to respond to a no-deal Brexit.On Thursday, EU leaders will meet in Brussels at a European Council summit to decide on a possible extension of Article 50, which MPs backed in a vote last week.",eiv7qcw,b2vhld,b2vhld,7.18E-08,-0.999999856,Against,19-03-19

If it was genuine dislike of the EU as a government structure, rather than dislike of the people within it, you'll be all right after Brexit because the EU will no longer be your government but only an external one.If, on the other hand, Brexit was driven by xenophobia, you have a problem: Brexit won't mean less foreigners (they'll just come from different places or through different channels) so the people pushing it won't be satisfied. Worse, they will be validated in their opinion and, having been given a platform and being allowed to pursue a major policy change once, will empower them to become ever more active (and probably more radical). For a comparable phenomenon, look at Trump who mainly thrives on xenophobia: his policies are ineffectual and won't actually achieve the goals of his supporters (and will probably cause significant harm to them) but that doesn't matter. After he is gone, the people who supported him will simply be more radical, more angry and more empowered.

201789,13,Vladimir_Chrootin,"I can remember food in the 1980s - it was nothing like the ""bad old days"", but there were a lot of people around who cooked like the war had never ended, and it wasn't entirely down to the availability of ingredients or restaurant workers.Postwar Britain was a nation of very fussy eaters, but, bizarrely, we always circled back to the idea of nauseating flavourless slop as a staple diet.  Vegetables had to be boiled forever in case you tasted them; seasonings unavailable in the 18th century were to be avoided entirely or used in very low concentrations to avoid them being noticed.Today, it hasn't entirely gone away; about 10 years ago I bought some cheese for my ex-wife's grand-parents, who were visiting.  I played safe and bought some Red Leicester, only to be rebuffed with ""we've never had that"" and the cheese remained untouched - solely because *it was too exciting to even try*.  This was the mentality that kept British food in a wartime state, rather than the specific availability of ingredients.I think what changed was that as it became easier to travel abroad, a bulk of people had their eyes opened to greater possibilities so changed their perspective on the kind of food they wanted to eat, and the EU was instrumental in allowing that to happen.  I don't think that the heirarchy of *haute cuisine* had much to do with stimulating demand; Keith Floyd, after all, was self taught, and nobody in British cuisine has been more influential, but the idea that you could just jump in the car, drive to Europe and eat the foods we'd been imitating badly for decades was the deciding factor.The problem with Brexit is that all the old spam-eating regressives are now back at the forefront of politics.

For example we opted-out of the Charter of Fundamental Rights (along with Poland), but the UK isn't exactly somewhere that has a massive human rights problem, and we are a signatory to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (notably we pushed to make it legally binding). We opted out of the Euro, but so did many other countries. We're not part of Schengen along with Ireland, which has some sense since we're island nations and not part of the EU mainland.In terms of financial concessions, these are negotiated as part of the EU budget - although we do hold a veto over the UK rebate. But it is there for a reason, it's not just something the EU agreed to without thought. It's well known that the CAP has a big impact on French farming and without the UK rebate we'd be paying 60% more into the EU budget than France does because of this. We've offered to reduce our rebate if there is CAP reform.Totally agree on that. If there is one thing the UK is good at, it's the tabloid press! We did have some press reform, but it was largely aimed at reforming articles about celebrities and even then appears to have had little effect. But to be honest social media is becoming a wider problem. Falsehoods can spread so fast and there is little that can be done against someone reposting a 'fact' to their friends.There has always been a right-wing, anti-Europe party in the EU parliament.

202203,13,eulenauge,"Next Friday, March 29, is supposed to be the British peopleâ€™s Independence Day. But because the elites control London from Brussels, the will of the people is likely to be ignored.Nearly three years ago, the British people shocked the global power-brokers by voting to leave the European Union. Promises were made, elections were held, and debates over Great Britainâ€™s exit plan from the EU began shortly after, with every politician promising to respect the decision of the people. Britons were told to wait, to be patient and to trust the politicians.But, was it all a ruse?Since 2016, Prime Minister Theresa May has promised on more than 50 separate occasions that Britain would leave the EU on March 29 2019. She needs to honour that promise.But Mrs May ignored advice from my father, and ultimately, a process that should have taken only a few short months has become a years-long stalemate, leaving the British people in limbo.Now, the clock has virtually run out and almost all is lost â€“ exactly as the European elites were hoping. Some pro-Brexit politicians even suggest that Mrs May herself is trying to sabotage Brexit, by insisting that Parliament agree to a deal that essentially keeps Britain bound to the EU indefinitely.With the deadline fast approaching, it appears that democracy in the UK is all but dead.Why is this important for us Americans? Because Brexit is an example of how the establishment elites try to subvert the will of the people when theyâ€™re given the chance.Here in the United States, weâ€™ve seen similar efforts to overturn legitimate election results. When my father beat the Washington establishment in a historic outcome in 2016, just a few months after the Brexit vote, we mistakenly presumed there would be a peaceful and respectful transition of power from the Democrats to the Republicans, just as there has always been in this country.Instead, the Democrats and deep-state operatives in our justice system have been colluding to subvert the will of the American people, with high-level officials even discussing a scheme to try to remove him from office using the 25th Amendment of our constitution.In a way, you could say that Brexit and my fatherâ€™s election are one and the same â€“ the people of both the UK and the US voted to uproot the establishment for the sake of individual freedom and independence, only to see the establishment try to silence their voices and overturn their mandates.What weâ€™re seeing now in Washington, London and Brussels is the desperate, last-gasp attempt by those previously in power to cling on to what was once theirs in the face of an overwhelming mandate for change.Those who support my fatherâ€™s â€œAmerica Firstâ€ agenda should rest assured: the battle for independence isnâ€™t over; it has only just begun. The elites will not surrender their power lightly, and we shouldnâ€™t expect them to. But we need to keep fighting to reclaim it for the people.With Brexit in the balance, and the 2020 presidential elections just around the corner, the people of both the UK and the US must reaffirm the decisions they made in 2016 to stand up for themselves against the global elite.Donald Trump Jr is the executive vice president at the Trump Organization.",eiwm5mn,b31v6f,b31v6f,0.999999998,0.999999997,Brexit,19-03-19

Remember the bill to revoke Article 50 has already been passed by Parliament and received Royal Assent.The closest that could probably happen would be to fire Teresa May and appoint a new, pro-Remain prime minister.  Again, though, same problem -- Article 50's already been invoked, the best that could happen is the new prime minister would introduce a bill to cancel Article 50.  Such a move would largely be seen as anti-democratic and even the most hardcore Remainers would probably rebuke the new prime minister on the grounds of being illegitimate, not to mention eventually resulting in the dissolution of the monarchy.If she wanted to breach convention entirely, she could unilaterally notify the EU of her intent to cancel Article 50.

202323,13,crueldruid,"You're right of course. It's funny how this short exchange touches on some very profound aspects of how we look at democracy today.What all democratic countries have today is ""representative democracy"", which features elections. I think pretty much everyone today judges a democracy by how it has its elections. And judging by a lot of reactions, many people don't really know what ""representative democracy"" actually means.It's doesn't mean that an MP always has to align with what the constituents wants. The MP has to do what is in my best interests.Electing a representative is similar to hring a lawyer. I hire a lawyer *to represent me*, because if have trust he will make *better decisions than me* on legal matters.This system of representative democracy is just roughly 200 years old, while the concept (and praxis) of democracy is about 3000 years old.In fact, there was broad consensus in the 18th century (and before) that representative democracy would be the worst democratic system possible, as it would virtually guarantee government by the elite. And that is where we are today. Small wonder that there is massive discontent. People don't *feel* represented. This seems to be equally true on the left and the right.In the past, many democracies were based not on elections, but on lottery! Does that sound insane?There is a guy from Belgium, called David van Reybrouck (who holds a doctorate in cultural history and archeology), who wrote a thought provoking book called ""Against elections"". In it, he provides an excellent analysis of what's wrong with our current system, describes various other systems that were used in the past, and lays out proposals for a way forward. I can't recommend it enough to anyone who sees that our current system just is not working.[David van Reybrouck describing ""Against elections"" in under 4 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5lP87yJILs) [David van Reybrouck explaining why elections are outdated on France24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5hdt1xTc_Y)And no, you don't need a university degree of any sort to comprehend his book.

Of the three polls at the weekend he references, two were undertaken by YouGov and came to different conclusions, despite asking what might appear to be very similar questions! YouGov are also responsible for [another recent and quite misleading poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/b2g8si/twothirds_of_britons_support_the_porn_block_but/eism1oe/). So it would seem that YouGov will deliver you any answer you want.The third poll he mentions was 50% for and 39% against when asked that there should be some form of public vote. It does indicate less people saying 'not sure' or that there shouldn't be another vote, and an uptick in people saying that there should be a vote since last month ([see poll details here](https://whatukthinks.org/eu/questions/in-the-event-that-the-government-is-unable-to-get-its-brexit-deal-with-the-eu-through-parliament-do-you-think-there-should-be-some-form-of-public-vote-on-what-to-do-next/)). This is the crucial period where we've had TM present her deal twice and had various options voted down. It therefore would appear to support the contention that the public are slowly coming round to another vote.As I said at the top, what none of this indicates is how people would vote. There are a lot of people who are bored of Brexit and want some certainty. They therefore may not support a public vote and would probably be equally happy with Parliament picking no deal, deal or remain - so long as something happens. But that doesn't mean that given the opportunity to vote that they wouldn't vote, or that they would support a particular position.

202430,13,Journey2theWest,"The inevitable triumph of reality over idealism It is human nature that has defeated both the UK and EU in the passed two years. The authors of Article 50 clearly had the best intentions and aspirations for a situation they hoped, and expected, would never occur. A reasonable length of time in which to ensure that the most important and vital of interests and cooperative projects kept running so that any nation leaving the EU (and of course the EU itself) could overt immediate risks and focus on longer term negotiations for all aspects of a future, hopefully healthcare , relationship.This is not however the spirit in which either side approached the two year negotiation period. The nature of humans is to service their own interests first. It is clear both sides wanted to not â€˜give awayâ€™ too much. The result being that: what is vital and what is important has given way to what is politically efficient and effective.Both sides have behaved as if the leaving deal on 29th March would be the final picture and not a transitional point and as such both sides have failed to really honor the intention of article 50.The outcome is likely â€˜No dealâ€™ which may at this point is not without virtue, as it will no doubt lead to a sharp focus on both sides about what is vital and what is important. Ask a Spanish farmer what is vital and important or a British (or German) auto-worker!Ask the smaller EU nations how they feel about the block being 39 billion out of pocket, with Germany and France advocating very different views on the future of EU, while Germany is caught smack in the middle of a trade war between the world two most powerful world  economies having just lost its third biggest trading partner.Ask my friend who is landing in France on a British passport just after Brexit occurs (if it occurs) how they feel right now?It is appalling that UK government has allowed it to go on this long without even a consensus amongst themselves.This is in no small part due to Corbyn; who is every bit a culpable as May. In defense of our worse prime minister (certainly in my life time) at least she has had a vision. Under Corbynâ€™s leadership (a man who until recently was consistently anti-EU) Labour has been schizophrenic on this issue.McDonnell talked about the tories Brexit moving closer towards the Labour vision. Maybe he is the only one in the country who actually knows what Labourâ€™s vision for Brexit is. And letâ€™s not even start on the â€˜Traitors in Governmentâ€™ or TIG. Opportunism isnt virtue. They have pushed Corbyn, May, Farage, Johnson and co out of my top 10 most odious politicians. Adding to the chaos at this time is the most unpatriotic thing they could possibly have done and no amount of virtue signaling changes that.However EU has its share of the blame also. Their reckoning is coming in May when the Member nations deliver the most anti EU European Parliament in history (Farage looks like a lefty compared with some of the likely candidates!). EU policies in recent years have seen previously very liberal countries face the reality of immigration without limits and unsurprisingly seek leadership with harder hearts and more nationalist politics. The nations that have resisted immigration the hardest now face a future where staying in Europe may see them forced to accept significant changes to their cultural, ethnic, and religious demographics.Economically countries like Italy and Greece who have been the worst casualties of economic union may look to China rather than Germany for their salvation.And, as if to parody the divisions in UK politics, the EU and itâ€™s constituent countries have many issues of their own. Germany and France (or at least the future leadership of Germany and Macron) could not be further apart on their visions for the future. Hungarian leadership is about to be booted from Europeâ€™s leading party and in Germany her own party conveniently didnâ€™t invite Merkel to their conference on immigration. The EU is 27 nations united by a common set of policies that none of them are really happy with. It is fear that things could be worse rather than optimism that things will get better that currently holds Europe together.In short on both sides of the negotiating table itâ€™s a total mess. What ever the next week brings, it will bring into focus the things that are (I will say it again) important and the things which are vital. The next few months will certainly be tougher and more chaotic in a no deal scenario, but that scenario does not prevent the UK and EU forging longer term agreements which will look very similar to those that would have existed had we left under Mays deal.The virtue of no deal is that it is decisive and ends the uncertainty that currently cripples both EU and UK in their future planning. In this respect I canâ€™t imagine why the EU would entertain an extension (except for a 2nd referendum between no deal and remain and to be completed ahead of EU elections). Perhaps there is still a small sliver of daylight passing through the nearly closed door, but even this will just prolong the process with no guarantee that it will improve the situation on either side.My advice, buy the things you like in slightly higher volume, determine to make the best of a bad situation, tell your family you love them and your friends your thinking of them, stay calm and carry on.",NA,NA,b32tt1,1.54E-06,-0.999996915,Against,19-03-19

202505,13,MGBricks,"Full guardian article - Theresa May will be forced to write to EU leaders on Wednesday and beg them to delay Brexit, with her cabinet deadlocked over the best way out of what Downing Street now concedes is a â€œcrisisâ€.The government had maintained until the last possible moment that Brexit could go ahead as planned on 29 March or after a brief â€œtechnical extensionâ€.But after the Speaker, John Bercow,Â ruled the prime ministerÂ could not put her deal to parliament unchanged for a third â€œmeaningful vote,â€Â her spokesman conceded it was now too late to leave with a deal.He said May would write to the European council president, Donald Tusk, to ask for an extension to article 50, before EU leaders meet in Brussels on Thursday. He declined to say how long a delay she would request, or for what purpose, simply insisting: â€œYouâ€™re going to have to wait for that letter to be published.â€Asked whether May agreed with the solicitor general,Â Robert Buckland, who described the situation after Bercowâ€™s ruling on Monday as a â€œconstitutional crisisâ€, her spokesman said: â€œIf you were to look back at the speech the prime minister gave, just before meaningful vote two, she said that if MPs did not support meaningful vote two we would be in a crisis. Events yesterday tell you that that situation has come to pass.â€Ministers discussed Brexit for about 90 minutes at what several sources said was a testy cabinet meeting on Tuesday.Insiders said opinion was more or less evenly divided, between those who favoured requesting a short, three-month extension, leaving in place the prospect of a no-deal Brexit in the summer, and those who want to see a much longer delay. Several sources said ministers emerged from cabinet unclear about what Mayâ€™s personal position was on the best way forward.Brexit-backing ministers, including leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, protested strongly about the idea of a long extension. They intend to lobby May again in the next 24 hours in a bid to quash the idea.Leadsom even warned that she now believed her colleagues were trying to thwart Brexit: â€œThis used to be a cabinet that would deliver Brexit, but now from what Iâ€™m hearing it doesnâ€™t seem like it is,â€ she said.May also met backbench colleagues to sound them out about the next steps, including the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who is widely regarded as the potential frontrunner in a leadership contest should the prime minister step aside.One cabinet source said: â€œThe current position is untenable; if they just accept a long extension the party will split.â€Some members of the backbench European Research Group (ERG) at their regular meeting in Westminster on Tuesday nightopenly called for the prime minister to step aside.However, several leave-supporting MPs said they had been reassured that Mayâ€™s intention was still to push ahead with Brexit as rapidly as possible and that she would only accept a longer extension if forced into it by Brussels.The EUâ€™s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, hinted on Tuesday that Brussels would demand a clear answer to the question of how the government intended to proceed as the quid pro quo for granting an extension.â€œThe key questions will be: does an extension increase the chances of the ratification of the withdrawal agreement? Will the UK request an extension because it wants a bit more time to rework the political declaration?â€ Barnier said. â€œIf not, what would be the purpose and outcome of an extension? And how can we ensure that at the end of a possible extension we are not back at the same situation as we are today?â€Any extension would have to be approved by a vote in both houses of parliament next week because the 29 March date is written into the EU Withdrawal Act.Ministers have promised that parliament will have the opportunity to debate how it could decide on an alternative approach next Monday, but Mayâ€™s spokesman insisted her priority was to continue to try to win over MPs to her deal.â€œThe prime minister has set out that she believes that the deal she has secured from the EU is a good one, and that it is the best deal available, and she continues to work on finding a way for parliament to pass that deal, so that we can get on with leaving the EU as quickly as possible,â€ the prime ministerâ€™s spokesman said.Negotiations with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) have continued since the weekend in the hope that if its leaders signal support for her approach, key Brexiters including Jacob Rees-Mogg could swing their weight behind it.One strand of the talks has involved Philip Hammond discussing post-Brexit options for taxing goods crossing the Irish border. â€œThe chancellor is a crucial figure in all this because customs and excise comes under his remit,â€ said a source with knowledge of the negotiations.â€œThe problem that is being discussed is how to tax goods â€“ where they might be taxed, away from the border or otherwise â€“ and how that might be doneâ€.The DUPâ€™s Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Nigel Dodds have also met Mayâ€™s de facto deputy, David Lidington, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, and the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill.Discussions have centred on how Northern Irish politicians will maintain some political oversight of the backstop, the agreement to maintain an open border on the island of Ireland in the event that the UK leaves the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal.",eix6ncw,b3515b,b3515b,1.39E-09,-0.999999997,Against,20-03-19

It is not a matter of being nice or mean with UK. It is a matter of not bringing saboteurs inside the EU parliament. At the very least, a demand for a delay should acknowledge that problem and propose ways to mitigate it. Personally, I don't see any acceptable way to do it: either there is a vote, and 50% of brexiter are sent as UK MEPs, or the current one are prolonged and we keep that awesome fellow Farage, or, as apparently has been the case once during an acceptation process, MEPs are not elected but nominated through a negotiated process, which would be sabotage as well, as it saps the democratic aspects of EU.I would be very disappointed if one of these options were accepted by EU leaders.There may be solutions I don't foresee, but neither seems UK to see them either, they don't seem to even understand there is a problem or even to think it is possible for EU to refuse a delay.",eixaem8,eiwnzd6,b2yr66,0.039095318,-0.921809364,Against,20-03-19

Voters were assured by some prominent Leave campaigners that ""No Deal"" would never happen &amp; that of course we'd stay in the Single Market-	 the Remain campaign was not much better - which is to say it was appalling Leave won by 1.2 million votes. That means if all of the above lead to a swing of less than 635,000 votes, it will have changed a Remain win to a Leave win, and a certainly know people who voted based on outright lies. What I find really scary is what's happened since - people are still so ill informed, some even think ""No Deal"" = stay in the EU, and many are so weary with it all they just want it over and done with. The BBC is doing an awful job and polls aren't showing a shift in opinion. I know numerous people who voted Remain but would vote Leave in the event of another ref because they (mistakenly IMO) believe the democratic thing to do is follow through on a ""democraticly run"" referendum result. And you'd think people who now know they were lied to would change their mind, but I'm fucked if I understand the psychology but even they are now doubling down. And yet I understand your sentiment. Like many here I'm incredible frustrated &amp; embarrassed. Personally I don't believe my family and I should be ""fucked over"" or that the majority want this but I am shocked by how many do and how many don't seem to care. If you'd asked me if this could happen, back in 2015, I'd have said no with confidence, but as agitators know, a small minority in the right places can disrupt a large, ill-informed majority, and the scale and pace of it all is quite frightening.

For the best chance to succeed it has to be done when MPs on both sides feel it provides an escape option.The EU is allowed to turn down a request for an extension. If asked for any extension (long or short) and it isn't requested with an indication of how it will be used to make progress, such as having a referendum, then they can simply turn it down.It is certainly true that something would need to be done about the election. The UK has put aside money to run the election here, so we are prepared.

202834,13,HumbrolUser,"I think an interesting idea (because I don't know everything), is how Bercow's or perhaps the table office' rejection would look like. Would be be public in a meeting in parliament, or would it be just some formal letter? I would think that a rejection would be announced at a meeting in parliament, but maybe that is not how things work. I can only imagine that parliament itself has to be kept updated, and any rejection would be public in some form I guess, so maybe no chance for the UK government to hide the fact that a third motion was perhaps denied by Bercow or perhaps denied by the table office.In our time and age, I think it is entirely proper, so assume that, any spin or bias, or angle on news, or even omissions of some types of news, put forth in any particular media, might as well stem from whoever owns the particular media. Presumably any larger media corporation would surely be in it to make money, or possibly influencing society in ways. If there is a large neutral, do goody good good newspaper out there, I don't believe  it.If OP had paid a minimum amount of attention when Bercow announced his statement the other day, OP would know that the prime minister is fully allowed to make a change to her presentation of the deal in order for parliament to vote on it.

Yet she is thrown out again and again to beg for forgiveness and better deal from the EU, with nothing to offer in replacement. Thats not how the world works.Its just like having to take a shitty project at work that needs to get done, but you know before you take it that it will be a nightmare and will never make your company any profit. Someone else has sold the project for 10000 when you need to spend 20000 to do the job.  What you try to do is to cut all possible expenses while delivering the minimum viable project for 15000. You will still get yelled by your boss because the project cost more than your company gained for it, and you get yelled by your client that the quality of the work is bad.Not to mention that i doubt it was her that wrote the whole deal on behalf of UK, that is why you have your officials/public servants or what ever they are called that actually negotiate all the fine details. Changing her wont change a thing. What you need to to do is drop all your red lines and negotiate, if you lock out things like no hard borders and no free movement etc. will cut out your options, and increase the cost you have to pay.

202861,13,eulenauge,"Dobovisek: Let's start with a very short and simple question, which probably isn't that easy to answer, Mr Juncker, to warm you up, so to speak. When is the Brexit coming?Juncker: The question is simple; the answer is difficult.Dobovisek: What is it?Juncker: It's a fact that, in all probability, Great Britain will not resign on 29 March as planned, because there is no majority for nothing in the British House of Commons. Last Monday I spent three or four hours negotiating with Theresa May in Strasbourg. We reached an agreement. But the British Parliament did not agree. ""We need reliable information from the British Government'.Dobovisek: The British Prime Minister wanted to send a letter to the EU - as she announced yesterday - asking for an extension of the deadline for Brexit. Has the letter arrived yet?Juncker: As far as I know - we are now ten past eight this morning; I have not yet been to the office; I am sitting here jovially on my bed and talking to you - as far as I know, this letter has not arrived. But we need this letter because we need to get clarity about the real intentions of the United Kingdom.The answer to the question you are asking me is largely in Britain. We as the European Commission, as the European Union, have done everything we can to reach an agreement. We have also amended treaty texts with the British Prime Minister on several occasions. But these Treaty texts do not seem to have the support of the British Parliament.But we need reliable information about the real intentions of the British Government, the British Parliament. We have not yet received these final commitments from the British Parliament and the British Government.Dobovisek: Now the BBC reports a few minutes ago that Mrs May will probably not apply for a long extension, but only a short one. We are talking about two to three months. You have just pointed out the problem, Mr Juncker. What would these months actually bring?Juncker: These months must ultimately result in the British Parliament giving its assent to the text of the Treaty before us. If this does not happen and if Great Britain does not leave at the end of March as planned, then we are - I do not like to say this - actually in God's hands. But I believe that God also has a thread of patience which will eventually break.Dobovisek: What about your patience thread? Has it torn in the meantime?Juncker: I didn't know at all that my patience thread would be as long as it has been in the last weeks, days and months. But we need clarity and the answer is from London. We have to agree. But there are no renegotiations, no renegotiations and no supplementary insurance to the supplementary insurance that has already been provided.Dobovisek: Basta! Out! Eat or die, one could say. No renegotiations, that's it?Juncker: I will not become SchrÃ¶der at an advanced age and will not simply say ""basta! We will stay in conversation with the British. We are not in a state of war with Great Britain, we are in a state of negotiation. But the negotiations have been concluded. ""We have moved intensely towards Britain'.Dobovisek: But then again the question: If both sides do not move, what would an extension of the deadline bring?Juncker: I am capable of any movement. But we have moved intensively towards Great Britain. More is not possible! The end of the flagpole has been reached. If other scenarios are to be discussed now, then we need a new flagpole. Whether we touch it, however, is written in the stars.Dobovisek: Let's see if there is still so much steel there because of the punitive tariffs. Let's ask the other way around: when Theresa May travels back to Brussels tomorrow, because that's where the EU summit with the Heads of State and Government of the European Union begins, what does she have to have in her luggage, so that there could be agreement for an extension of the deadline?Juncker: She must have in her luggage an agreement to the negotiated treaty. It must have a clear idea of time in its luggage. My assessment - and this will perhaps surprise you - is that there will be no decision-making this week at the European Council, but that we will probably have to meet again next week, because Mrs May has no agreement to anything either in her cabinet or in Parliament.As long as we do not know what Great Britain could say yes to, we cannot reach a decision. My assessment this morning at a quarter past eight is that we will not have to come to wrap-up this week, but will have to meet again next week.""The hard Brexit would be a lose-lose game.""Dobovisek: Are you expecting a hard Brexit at the end of March despite all the meetings that may come and follow?Juncker: I don't wish that because the hard Brexit would be, as we say in German, a lose-lose game. Everyone will lose. A no deal is the worst of all possibilities. The best way would be for the British Parliament to get its act together and agree to the text of the Treaty as it stands. I am going into this week's European Council, Thursday and Friday, not cheerfully, but calmly.Dobovisek: Let us take a step back together, Mr Juncker. Prime Minister David Cameron once brought the Brexit referendum into play. Then followed a splitting populist election campaign with known results. European elections are now on the agenda. Are personal egotisms and popular slogans shaping the Europe of the future?Juncker: No! This will probably be the case in Britain. But we have other things to do than just the Brexit deal. There are major problems on the doorstep. Our relationship with China, our efforts to boost investment in Europe, despite the fact that we have already launched EUR 380 billion of investment, thanks to the Juncker Plan, which is no longer called that.In the beginning this investment programme was called the Juncker Plan because people thought it would go wrong and then we have to identify who is to blame. Now it is working and now it is called the European Strategic Investment Fund.

As no-one wants a border in Ireland and UK does not want a border in the Irish sea, the only way there is a deal is if UK relents or Ireland somehow leaves EU and agrees to a customs union with UK or makes EU deals that practically make it do that.The magical unicorn option in the Malthouse Compromise was to have some super futuristic tech and stuff instead of a hard border. That's not feasible at this tech level.The final option I guess some MPs think is feasible is if EU just decides to keep the border open without a customs union. Yeah, no. This would lead to so much trouble internationally that it is not gonna happen.

203613,13,Kebriones,"Finally. I just saw Commons moan about May. Yes, May is terrible. But she still has your confidence. Yes, she has no plan besides her own deal. But this is also because parliament is split over 5 different things; no deal, May's deal, new negotiations for a customs union, referendum, and revoke article 50. And no one wants to go with the lesser evil. They all want their favourite flavour, despite it not having a majority. And the no deal leavers actually have the upper hand here. As long as Commons cannot agree, there will be a no deal. So they don't need to pass a vote for no deal. They just need to be sure none of the other things pass. This is also why the vote against a no deal was completely meaningless and why people inside the EU, like the PM of the Netherlands, were so aghast as Westminster proudly claimed they had averted a no deal. So you can take the ERG out of the equation. They will never back any plan.&amp;#x200B;So right now it is really up to people like Corbyn, who want to reset negotiations and start all over, and those who want a referendum, to realize that these options are not realistic. It is either no deal, May's plan, or revoke article 50. For everything else, there is no more time. And to a lesser extend also those who want to revoke or want Mays deal. Do they want to abandon their favourite flavour to prevent a no deal? Or will they allow a no deal to happen? And they want the other side to blink first. And this is also what will happen in the end. Will those Tories that rules out a no deal back remain? Or will everyone else back May's deal to stop the ERG from getting what they want?&amp;#x200B;The will of the people is to avoid a no deal at all cost, as  this is basically the only thing a lot of PMs agree on.

203837,13,dlab,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_GeopoliticsHoover Institution senior fellow John B. Dunlop stated that ""the impact of this intended 'Eurasianist' textbook on key Russian elites testifies to the worrisome rise of fascist ideas and sentiments during the late Yeltsin and the Putin period"".[1]Military operations play relatively little role. The textbook believes in a sophisticated program of subversion, destabilization, and disinformation spearheaded by the Russian special services. The operations should be assisted by a tough, hard-headed utilization of Russia's gas, oil, and natural resources to bully and pressure other countries.[9]The United Kingdom should be cut off from Europe.[9]Russia should use its special services within the borders of the United States to fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke ""Afro-American racists"". Russia should ""introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements â€“ extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S. It would also make sense simultaneously to support isolationist tendencies in American politics"".[9]The Eurasian Project could be expanded to South and Central America.[9]",eizi7r2,eizcumu,b3ejdh,1.06E-06,-0.999997878,Against,20-03-19

A lot don't use their ""own kind"" to abuse because morals? I'm not quite sure which gang that recently got exposed had a whole other side of people pretty much ignoring the problem because they were afraid to seem racist (that might be a bit of the reason but it is mostly the incompetence of our police force). They are usually centred in non metropolitan areas making it harder for police to be able to react or even get information. In a mental gymnastics kind of way the country is protecting these gangs but no more or less than any other gang. People just like to pick and choose what bit of context to support their claims but forget that brown people aren't the only ones doing shitty things. I can almost bet my left tit and right nipple that British people are doing atrocious things in other countries.I guess my point is in our country is we should fight the problem not the people and use all relevant context to support our claims instead of nit picking and missing out detail because we don't want to tarnish the image of our side.

It protects rape gangs anywayâ€, implying the UK in the EU would protect Pakistani rape gangs more than if it were out. I replied pointing out that actually the opposite is true - as proven by data, brexiteer has had a skyrocketing effect on Asian migration and it will likely keep doing so even more once itâ€™s completed (Sajid Javid himself said basically as such). This logically implies that the likelihood of having Pakistani *everything* will go further up, including Pakistani gangs. So if you voted for brexit, you did also vote for more Pakistani gangs, in practice. I would also add that, by logical conclusion, if Brexit really happens and you really donâ€™t want to live in a country with an increased likelihood of having Pakistani criminals, your only option left is to leave the UK.I know brexiteers struggle with subtlety. Iâ€™m trying to be helpful here.(To avoid accusations of racism, Iâ€™ll point out that this doesnâ€™t mean Pakistanis are more likely to be in gangs than, say, the French or Swedish.

The spokesman said:President Juncker said to the prime minister that he thinks itâ€™s a good idea she sets out her thoughts to the leaders ahead of the EU Council.However, the president has clearly warned the prime minister against including a date for the extension that will be after the European parliament elections. Thatâ€™s why he repeated in this call his advice, which he set out inÂ his letter on March 11, that the withdrawal has to be complete before May 23, otherwise we risk facing institutional difficulties and legal uncertainty, given the European elections date.European elections have to be held if the extension date is beyond May 23. This is the position of the commission and this is what the president informed the prime minister again.Earlier on Wednesday, a leaked letter circulated among the EUâ€™s 28 commissioners reiterated Junckerâ€™s position that the extension had to be limited if elections in Britain were to be avoided",NA,NA,b3c4nn,0.998119016,0.996238032,Brexit,20-03-19

It will decide next Monday if they should all become operational, enacting no-deal plans in 30 central government departments and 42 local councils, two devolved governments and in Northern Ireland.About Â£1.5bn has been allocated to Brexit planning, with three departments getting an extra Â£25m for Operational Yellowhammer.Kent is also going ahead with its contingency plans to prevent gridlock on its roads in the event of congestion in Dover or Calais.Concrete barriers have already been erected on the main port artery in Kent, with a section of the London-bound M20 between junction 8 and junction 9 now operating as a 50mph contraflow for normal traffic. Work on signage will be completed over the weekend.The coastbound section will be closed off to all but lorry traffic from next week to allow Highways England to carry out a dry run to cope with possible chaos after 11pm on 29 March.A full meeting of Kent county council will be held at 10am on Thursday to discuss Brexit preparedness, including a checklist received from the local government secretary, James Brokenshire, of issues relating to transport, supply chains, statutory services and regulatory services.Last yearÂ the council warnedÂ it might have to deal with 10,000 lorries parked or queuing on its roads with a knock-on impact on schools, hospitals, rubbish collections and morgues.The council has already conducted three live tests for its contingency, code-named Exercise Pale Fox, with Operation Fennel for traffic management going into action based on assumptions of six months of disruption, according to an agenda for the council meeting.Manston airport near Ramsgate is in the final stages of preparation for use as a lorry park for up to 6,000 heavy goods vehicles in the event of gridlock.Councillors will also hear from adult social care and health officers who have plans to minimise the risk of disruption to admissions of patients to hospitals, residential care homes and the supply of fuel, medication, cleaning and sanitation products.Schools have also been issued with Brexit guidelines warning them to think twice before closing down in the event that staff cannot make it through the gridlock.Extra trading standards officials have been hired for a new ports team in Dover â€œas a result of the predicted increase in referralsâ€ once EU standards are no longer guaranteed in imports.The council is also on standby in the event that â€œhigh-risk animal feed is landedâ€ from outside the EU but transported through the bloc to Dover.â€œTrading standards would have to intervene at the Port of Dover if high-risk animal feed is landed, as it would be an illegal import and would need to be destroyed,â€ says the council agenda.According to reports, the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told cabinet ministers in a letter: â€œOperation Yellowhammer command and control structures will be enacted fully on 25 March unless a new exit date has been agreed between the UK and the EU.â€Earlier this year, the chief executive of the civil serviceÂ said the government wouldnever be fully prepared for BrexitÂ as he revealed plans to move up to 5,000 staff into an emergency command and control centre in the event of no deal.UKâ€™s emergency plans for no-deal Brexit begin to be put into actionhttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/20/uks-emergency-plans-for-no-deal-brexit-begin-to-be-put-into-action?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard",NA,NA,b3gtw5,3.37E-10,-0.999999999,Against,20-03-19

204407,13,Apprentice57,"To say I'm a bit torn on the current Democratic field would be an understatement. But mostly for a good reason in that I like most of the options. I could write a tome, but basically I think the best options are:Former Vice President Joe Biden: He's well known, he's popular, and (sad as it is to admit) he's a white man in a contest that favors white men. If your ultimate goal is to beat Trump, well, I think he's the best option. He's a bit older and more conservative than I'd like.Senator Bernie Sanders: I just like this guy the best personally, and I supported him in 2016 as well. He comes across as very genuine, and is the most left leaning candidate in the field (and I'm pretty much far left for this country). I think his age is a legitimate concern, otherwise I'd probably wholeheartedly support him. Electability is an interesting question with Sanders, being a white man helps him but he doesn't do well with our minority voters (while Biden does do well).Senator Kamala Harris: In a field full of really old candidates and probably too young fresh blood, Harris is a good mixture of fresh (first term senator), and experienced (was an attorney general beforehand). She's quite left/progressive, and forms a strong foil to Trump (in addition to policies, she's a woman, and is of Indian and Jamaican ancestry).Former Representative Beto O'Rourke: Very fresh white dude who all us young people love. He lost, but strongly overperformed in a Texas senate race last november. He brands himself as a stylistic moderate, but is still pretty left leaning. I think he's a bit too young to be effective, but he would be an excellent vice presidential pick for someone like Harris.If I had to vote right now, I'd probably pick Harris. But something about her is unsettling to me. A lot of reddit probably won't be crazy about her due to her past career as a prosecutor.Haha, of course!

As worded, though, sure it'll get lots of votes, but there were millions of remain votes in the referendum so that's not a surprise.  Petitions don't really work unless they can show something that wasn't obvious before.That the leave-voting public is more patient than politicians is one. Most leave voters, I suspect, have a very good sense that if the UK were to revoke, it'd still be a thorn in the side of the UK to have a member wanting to leave who hasn't left holding things up. And that they can sit in the status quo and let that discomfort to the EU drive the changes they want. Just the fact of the UK wanting to leave has already put a dampener on EU migration and caused wages to start rising.

Couldn't the next gov't have another non-binding vote, to rejoin the EU?I don't know what you think of how things work here, but it's a pipe dream to think that everything can be rolled back, much less that it could be done in less than two years.Hopefully the Democrats will not self-destruct, many of the new people in the house, seem to be going forward with their agendas, much like the Tea Party Republicans did before.  If the Democrats are able to win the House again (everyone comes up every two years), and they are able to make gains in the Senate (where they serve staggered six year terms) in 2020, and the Democrats are able to find/pick someone who will be able to bring the voters out, then there is a chance.  That things will get better, but even so a lot of damage has been done, and for those who are/were hurt, a change won't make the things that have already happened just suddenly go away.I get it the grass is always greener on the other side, and if and the other posters want to insist just how much worse things are then so be it.It sucks that the people of the UK voted to Leave, it sucks that the UK govt seems to be unable or unwilling to ensure that a no-deal won't happen (well nothing beyond a non-binding vote that a no-deal is unacceptable).I do hope that they realize that these political and self-motivated actions are very likely to end up hurting the people that they are supposed to represent.  And that they either vote for the deal that's on the table or come up with something else that the EU will be able to agree on.The system for leaving the EU is heavily tilted and rightfully so, to make things ""not easy"" if not difficult for any member who decides that they want to leave.As long as the member is a member, they are essentially not ""allowed"" to make any laws, rules, agreements, deals before a deal is made with the EU first, this is to keep all the members from making deals on their own that would end up being a deal for every EU member nation.The people were asked, they voted, they should have realized the likely outcome, and yet they still voted leave.Yes, people and families are going to get hurt by Brexit, deal or no-deal.  I do think the pain/hurt will be significantly higher with a no-deal.  The parlament triggered the Article 50, and started the clock, without apparently really making any real plans or even having a real idea of what they wanted or realistically could get.It was made very clear before thee vote that the EU wouldn't and couldn't allow any member to leave with what was essentially a good/great deal, because that would be damaging to the EU as a whole, and yet the Brexit folks seem to still think that they can get all the benefits of being an EU member without any of the disadvantages.  That's simply unrealistic, and that kind/type of thinking is what's going to end up in a no-deal Brexit.I wish I could say that everything is going to be better, but I won't because that would a lie and potentially patronizing or even condescending.I do hope that things somehow suddenly and even magically ends up happening so that things don't end up going in the ""default"" and end up as a no-deal Brexit.",ej0ovsz,eiswdtp,b2a044,1.48E-08,-0.99999997,Against,21-03-19

Extending is not going to fix that, and will only result in more money and effort wasted.Refusing an extension without significant progress is exactly what is needed in order to force the UK to come to a decision.

205156,13,starwolf256,"I'm not British, but the way I see it is that a lot of new information has come to light.  The original vote was very vague - ""stay in"" or ""leave"", and the people campaigning for ""leave"" made a lot of promises that turned out to be completely false.  I think a second vote where the people are able to choose from the actual options available instead of pie-in-the-sky promises is the most democratic option.Even the British government is following this exact train of thought internally.  They recently held a vote to reject the current Brexit deal.  Then, a few days later, they held another vote, rejecting leaving without a deal.  Since that second vote, the government is trying to have a ""redo"" of the first vote, because people who previously rejected the deal may want to change their minds.  How is that any different than re-asking the people what they want?To give an example: I give you the choice of staying home and cooking dinner, or going out to a restaurant.  I hype up the restaurant wildly; it's the best food you'll ever eat, the atmosphere is fantastic, it'll change your life.  You agree to go out to eat, but when we arrive, the restaurant is filthy and the food smells vile.

Greece joined the EEC in 1981, Cyprus joined the now-EU in 2004. As we all know by now, Turkey also applied for EU accession but the process is blocked, in large part because of the unrisolved issue of their outstanding military occupation of ""Turkish Cyprus"".  So yeah, marginal role - because none of the involved countries were in the EEC back then.Same goes for the latest Balkan conflict. In fact, it is well-accepted that Croatia and Slovenia joining the EU likely avoided a repeat of hostilities (as they would likely be punished by the EU with some sort of expulsion, which they cannot economically afford), and that Bosnia and Herzegovina should also join as soon as it is feasible to do so (the territory has the most complicated issues with government, being split across three ethnic lines). Similarly, the military restraint shown by Serbia after the war is in no-small-part due to their desire to eventually join the EU too, once they manage to fully unshackle themselves from their dependence on Russia.""Krim"" I guess is Crimea, territory of Ukraine - again not an EU member state fighting another non-EU state. In fact, the Russian invasion of Crimea was triggered by Putin fundamentally accepting the inevitability of Ukraine joining the EU - something that often goes hand in hand with joining NATO.As for the Irish peace process, I defer to other comments on this page.

Problem is, it was not presented as such. It should have been evident from the beginning that it would be a loss. In theory, it could have been possible to mitigate those by epic international efforts, negotiating preparations of trade deals with other countries while the Brexit negotiation was going on, so that a quick transition would have been possible from a EU member to the head of a strong trade union.2 years could also have been used to prepare people to the arrival of a border in Ireland, giving concessions to all concerned parties. Or to disarm the DUP and make it accept a border between NI and England.In the end, a hard brexit will be a sovereignty gain, but at a colossal economic loss. UK was the English-speaking bridgehead to the EU. Nothing will replace that and several companies will likely have to move. The sovereignty gains will be real, but nothing seems to have been prepared to actually put them to use...And also, people who tout the gains in independence and control fail to realize that this also comes with a loss of power.I am watching from the other side of the world right now, and am not a UK citizen.

Well it can and it will, unless we work together instead against each other. Let's not forget that.'&amp;#x200B;Let's unpack the opening sentence. As many others in this thread have stated, some of us do remember the horrors of war, in Ireland, Cyprus, The Falklands, Israel and other places in current EU member states and non-EU member states. This is a sweeping statement based on your personal reality. I would add as a 'young German' are you not taught the horrors of the 2nd world war as part of your national school curriculum? I would have assumed that all young Germans growing up are educated on the horrors of war and potentially have direct family lineage that can still speak of it from the first person. 'we all think it could not happen again, since we did not experience it ourselves' again this is your opinion and personal reality, not necessarily the opinions of the world, EU citizens or British citizens. I for one am extremely aware of how close we are to conflict, not necessarily from a British perspective but from a global one. I have lived in South Korea, Israel and Argentina. I have experienced rockets flying overhead whilst protecting my children in bomb shelters, so have millions of others globally across all continents.&amp;#x200B;Your next line is fantastic...&amp;#x200B;'Well it can and it will, unless we work together instead against each other. Let's not forget that'.&amp;#x200B;Your assertion that 'it will' is a little terrifying. A direct statement that war WILL happen due to Brexit. Why do you feel this way? Is this a new EU directive given to (former) member states that upset the narrative? Is this another personal opinion due to a perceived betrayal because of Brexit? It's the direct assertion that war will happen that is really jarring and says an awful lot about how you think rather than I, hence my need to respond (which is incredibly rare). Yet, in your view it's the British who are being aggressive by simply just pointing this out? Just because we're not going to be in the EU doesn't equate to hostility from the British side that leads to war. We can still trade, send each other texts and debate on Reddit without being a part of the single market. Furthermore, we're not alone in our thinking that maybe being a part of the EU isn't for us. Are millions of people in the UK, Netherlands, Italy and other states all wrong? Do you believe the EU is some kind of utopia? It's saddening that for some leaving the EU creates a direct conflict that WILL lead to war (your words). I personally don't feel this way. Your closing statement of 'I wann be your friend not your enemy, brother' is reciprocated. However if being your friend is dependant on our countries inclusion of a union that we don't want to be a part of after a democratic vote then that's a little strange. &amp;#x200B;",ej1ther,ej1eedp,b3qepz,0.875152033,0.750304066,Brexit,21-03-19

Not just for itself and the EU, but for most of the planet. Because basically every one has to align with one of the big blocks to be able to trade and operate globally. The options being EU, US, China or, to a lesser extent, Russia. The US doesn't have too many followers of its regulations, partially due to their system of measurement. The other two.... Leaving the EU. And that's the one most nations use to model their rules and regulations on. Opting to be rule takers in order to have easy trade. (Making own rules is an option, but its expensive and likely no better than what the EU already has and wouldn't really be compatible with any one else. So why bother?)The empire is gone. The UK has less than 1% of the worlds population and has put its service and manufacturing industries on self-destruct. It's got no chance of it going it alone. Never mind leading others.

And that is one of the few things I agree with him on, so where has this sentiment disappeared too?In respect to you saying that we need to leave the EU before having another vote would be democratic, in this scenario that is simply not true.

Again, I stress that it has been three years, and with a vast pool of new information to draw on, I do not believe the result of the first referendum holds much weight with determining what the public wants any more. A new proposition should be put back to the public. Leave with the deal, leave with no deal, remain.

206027,13,eulenauge,"George Parker and Alex Barker in Brussels and Laura Hughes in London 21.03.'19In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Theresa May made a momentous choice. After a day of acrimonious debate in her cabinet and inner circle, the prime minister decided that she was willing to take Britain out of the EU without a deal.At Thursdayâ€™s European Council meeting in Brussels, EU diplomats wondered whether Mrs May was bluffing, but those close to the prime minister said if she cannot secure her Brexit deal she is determined the UK should embark on a no-deal exit.Since announcing on Wednesday that she would ask EU leaders for a short extension to the blocâ€™s Article 50 process â€” to delay Brexit from March 29 to June 30 â€” people who have spoken to the prime minister said she is reconciled to the implications of what happens if the UK parliament continues to reject her withdrawal agreement.â€œThe mood has hardened on no deal,â€ said one person close to the prime minister. One Eurosceptic Conservative MP who met Mrs May on Wednesday night said: â€œShe didnâ€™t seem concerned about leaving with no deal.â€The prime minister refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit as she arrived in Brussels, and in her preferred scenario this could happen on June 30.But French president Emmanuel Macron said that if the British parliament fails to approve Mrs Mayâ€™s Brexit deal in a vote earmarked for next week, the UK would be heading for a no-deal exit on March 29. EU leaders were on Thursday discussing an Article 50 extension, conditional on MPs approving Mrs Mayâ€™s withdrawal agreement.There is, of course, a big question over whether Mrs May would ever be allowed to let the UK crash out of the EU in the face of massive political and business opposition.If she loses what would be the third so-called meaningful vote by MPs on her deal next week, she would be under intense pressure to resign.Senior Europhile Conservative MPs speculated they could ultimately join with Labour to bring down the government in a vote of no confidence and force a general election, rather than allow Mrs May to â€” in their view â€” crash the economy.The House of Commons voted this month by 413 to 202 against the UK leaving the EU without an agreement. If Mrs May refused to heed this non-binding vote, MPs could try to seize control of the parliamentary agenda to change the law to stop a no-deal exit.â€œIt is a massive disaster, staggering incompetence,â€ said one influential Conservative MP. â€œShe is trying to keep the party together in an extraordinarily stupid way. We are heading for no deal, which would be the first time a developed economy has essentially placed sanctions on itself.â€Under the prime ministerâ€™s scenario planning, MPs have until April 11 to agree an exit deal: that is the legal cut-off date when Britain would have to legislate to take part in Mayâ€™s European Parliament elections. Mrs May is adamant Britain should not take part in those elections.If the Commons had not signed off her withdrawal agreement by April 11, the prime minister would step up preparations for a no-deal exit, working with the EU to try to mitigate the inevitable economic shock. Chancellor Philip Hammond has put aside Â£26bn in an â€œinsurance fundâ€ to cushion the immediate impact of the UK crashing out of the EU.In deciding she is willing to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, Mrs May has sided with Eurosceptic members of her cabinet and the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, who are sanguine or even enthusiastic about a â€œclean breakâ€ with the bloc.â€œShe seemed pretty down and low,â€ said one Conservative MP who met the prime minister on Wednesday night, shortly before she used a televised address to accuse parliament of letting down the country by not approving her deal.The prime ministerâ€™s stance on a no-deal exit has filtered out of her inner circle and caused alarm at senior levels of the government. â€œThe prime minister has caved into pressure from the ERG, at huge risk to the integrity and economic prosperity of the UK,â€ said one minister.The fact Mrs Mayâ€™s decision was taken in the early hours of Wednesday without formal cabinet approval has fuelled concerns in the Treasury about Mrs Mayâ€™s judgment. Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt on Thursday spoke of the â€œextraordinary pressureâ€ on the prime minister.Mrs Mayâ€™s allies said she will work with the EU to ensure the UK does not crash out of the bloc on March 29 but that she is serious when she insists she will not consider delaying Brexit beyond June 30.â€œWe are nearly three years on from the original vote,â€ said the prime minister on Thursday. â€œIt is now the time for parliament to decide. A short extension [to Article 50] gives us that opportunity to decide to leave the European Union, to deliver on the result of that referendum and I sincerely hope that will be with a negotiated deal.â€In Brussels, EU officials agreed with Mrs May that the â€œpoint of no returnâ€ will be in mid-April, but there are diverging views in European capitals about what she would do if she has not secured her Brexit deal by that point.One senior EU negotiator predicted Mrs May, at this juncture, would indeed put â€œparty over countryâ€ and take Britain out of the bloc without an agreement. â€œNo deal keeps her in power,â€ said the official.Other EU negotiators think the opposite, with one saying Mrs May had â€œtoo much integrityâ€ to accept a no-deal exit. â€œYou have to destroy the country to do this,â€ said the official, predicting Mrs May would delay Brexit for more than a year before resigning. â€œShe will not lead the country into the abyss.â€Additional reporting by Sebastian Payne in London and Michael Peel in Brussels",ej29ma8,b3upcl,b3upcl,0.697495292,0.394990585,Brexit,21-03-19

Anyone who is biased towards either way will be also biased in what they tell you about it. Unless there is some neutral third party that has nothing to gain or lose from the result that can scientifically analyze the effects you will not get a non biased knowledge.Almost every single referendum and vote is dubious by that logic because in every vote politicians (and the news) twist the truth and lie and omit facts. If someone gets into office by promising stuff to people and then betraying their promises, they wont be forced to step down. In every major decisions there will be misinformation because the people who will benefit from a certain end result will do whatever they have to to get that, even if that means lying. This happens in politics ever single day in every single country in this world pretty much. For example many countries voted to join the EU based on false promises. They didnt vote to join an eu that can create laws for your country, the eu they joined was something else and then EU took a few totalitarian tiptoes to end where it is now.As an example, the news and the politicians lied about there being weapons of mass destruction in iraq (and other things like saddam killing babies from incubators) and used that lie to go to war and even AFTER it came to light that they had lied they continued to war in Iraq.I dont think there is some single thing that ""we voted for"". I think people voted for various reasons and not for a single reason. There was no clear thing that we voted for, it wasnt a clear thing so to think there was some clear laid out thing that we voted for doesnt seem to be true.I am not, I just dont buy this idea that what the remain side says is truthful either.

At times when funding was cut to both the Police and NHS due to austerity.  Less police on streets, more crime.  Less Dr's and Nurses, worse NHS.   *""You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side.**""It is now time for MPs to decide.""*&amp;#x200B;No you are not, you just want to force the deal that you created through.  MP's have decided.  They don't want a No Deal, and they don't want Your deal.  However you have again refused to discuss other ways forward in getting this resolved. *""Do they want to leave the EU with a deal which delivers on the result of the referendum, that takes control of our money borders and laws while protecting jobs and our national security?**""Do they want to leave without a deal, or do they not want to leave at all causing potentially irreparable damage to public trust not just in this generation of politicians but to our entire democratic process?**""It is high time we made a decision.""*&amp;#x200B;I believe that they want to leave with a deal.  However you basically only gone to the Brexiteers to discuss this and no one else.  However no one in Parliament wants to leave with the deal that you have presented them with.Again they don't want to leave with out a deal.  But you only keep coming back with the same deal that everyone can see that is crap.  Strange that some MP's have only switched sides after promises of extra cash to their Constituencies.  Why couldn't that cash have been spent on the NHS and Police so they can do their jobs better.   *""So far, Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice.**""Motion after motion and amendment after amendment has been tabled without Parliament ever deciding what it wants.**""All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want.*&amp;#x200B;Again they have made a choice.   They don't want what is on the table. Has the PM come back with any other deal, or just the same one re-hashed.  If nothing has changed with the deal, then it will get rejected again and again.  How about talking to MP's to try and find out what they Do want then.  &amp;#x200B; *""I passionately hope MPs will find a way to back the deal I've negotiated with the EU, a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable.""*&amp;#x200B;Again, it is just your deal.  The deal that has been rejected.  Same old same old.  Nothing new in it.  &amp;#x200B; *""And I will continue to work night and day to secure the support of my colleagues, the DUP and others for this deal.""*&amp;#x200B;How about sitting down and thrashing it out what people want.  It will take time, but hell it has been 3 years nearly, so could have used that a bit more wisely? *""But I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the 30th of June.**""Some argue that I'm making the wrong choice and I should ask for a longer extension to the end of the year or beyond to give more time for politicians to argue over the way forward.""*&amp;#x200B;Can see her point, but if the time had been spent better at the beginning and even before the Referendum and put the case for staying firmly at the top, rather than just assuming Remain would win, perhaps we wouldn't be in the situation we are now in.&amp;#x200B; *""I don't believe that's what you want and it is not what I want.""*  &amp;#x200B;Has she asked the public what they want?  Or is it a case of not what I want, I'm in charge so do as I say.&amp;#x200B; *""We asked you the question already and you've given us your answer""*&amp;#x200B;Yes nearly 3 years ago.  Has been proven that the Leave side lied through their teeth to get the result they wanted.  so as the campaign was based on lies, why not hold another referendum and find out what the public want, with this time be-bunking all the lies that were told last time.&amp;#x200B;The question has been asked in Parliament already, but you seem to want to ask the same question again, even though it has been rejected twice already.  What is the difference?  Oh yeah, you control the agenda and have a week opposition to deal with so will just try and bully your way though.The PM has survived a personal Vote of No confidence, probably because there was no clear leader to take the role over and the rest of the party were worried about who would possibly take over.  Personally don;t think it was because of May's leadership skills that she won.&amp;#x200B;The Government won a Vote of No Confidence, not because anyone has any confidence in them, but because they were all looking after their own jobs.  If they lost they could have been voted out of office and no one like to lose a job.&amp;#x200B;Anyway that's my take on it all.  &amp;#x200B;",NA,NA,b3n9uy,1,1,Brexit,21-03-19

Imagine that somehow we manage to have Art. 50 revoked, and the UK stays a full member of the EU, with all the opt-outs and privileges that come with that.Arguably, the position of strength the UK has enjoyed in the past will be affected by the display of chaos and incompetence of the past 2+ years, which have put the country essentially at the mercy of the EU 27, with the government having to plead for an extension. Re-establishing its position in the EU as a committed member won't be easy, and will require time and concrete action.So what happens when talks about further political integration, federalism, joint defence, and the like, circulate once more? While once the UK could leverage on its position to obtain special treatment, I imagine this won't be as simple in the coming years. Which means that whatever government is in charge, they won't be able to obtain as much as before to placate those who will oppose changes. Which in turn means that the anti-EU sentiment will grow again. Even with ""remain"" being a majority, how strong would be the sentiment against those changes?**This boils down to the question(s): do you think the rise of ""remain"" indicates a real pro-EU stance, or is just opposition to (this) Brexit?

As you see, they are not all thinking the same: &amp;#x200B;  **""We have done our best,"" says Michel Barnier. ""Now the solution is in London.""****European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker: ""In the event the Withdrawal Agreement will not be approved by the House we have to come back (for another summit).""****French President Emmanuel Macron says he is ""totally open"" to a technical extension to Brexit, but the situation cannot be prolonged indefinitely.****He warns that if Theresa May's deal is rejected again, Britain is heading towards no-deal.****Macron says a longer Brexit extension would require a clear plan from London on how to proceed, with the ball in Britain's court as to what that new policy would be.****He adds that it is important for the EU to show that it respects the decision of the British people.** **We can't pretend after three years that they didn't vote to leave, Macron warns.****Merkel: We must work to the last moment**Speaking as she arrives for the EU summit, the German Chancellor says the endgame of Brexit is an historic moment.She says the bloc will do everything to ensure an orderly exit for Britain, working to the last moment to make sure this happens. But Merkel adds that the EU needs to prepare for the possibility that Theresa May's deal is defeated again.The bloc's room for manoeuvre is limited, however, she continues.**Latvian PM: Two alternatives if May's deal rejected again**Krisjanis Karins says Britain will have to leave with no deal or revoke Article 50 if the PM suffers a third defeat on her deal.""If the UK is leaving we would want that to be an orderly process so there has been a Withdrawal Agreement agreed over a two-year period - I don't see any chance of changing that,"" he said.""So the question is will the UK accept this agreement and then it will be an orderly withdrawal? No-one wants a chaotic withdrawal.""When asked what would happen if the deal is rejected, he replied: ""There are then two alternatives: either Great Britain withdraws Article 50 and stays in the European Union or there is a disorderly withdrawal.""**Dutch PM: Ball is in Britain's court**Arriving for the EU summit, Mark Rutte says a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" for Britain's economy.""The ball has to be in the court of the British Parliament. They first have to say 'yes',"" he said.""I think the signal today might be that if the British Parliament would say a 'yes' lock, stock and barrel to everything on the table, then Europe understands that technically that you need time to implement everything in law.""**Austrian leader addresses Brexit delay**Chancellor Sebastian Kurz says a delay to Brexit is better than Britain leaving without a deal, but ""important questions"" need to be answered before the EU grants an extension to Article 50.He adds that he does not want Britain to take part in May's European Parliament elections, calling such a prospect ""absurd"".**Lithuanian president comments on Brexit**Dalia Grybauskaite says the two options for extending Brexit are a short delay until May or a longer one, which would involve Britain taking part in EU Parliament elections.She says the former is the most likely option, adding that there is no point in the bloc giving anything when it doesn't know what the UK wants.**Irish PM speaking in Brussels**Leo Varadkar says an extension to Article 50 must have a purpose and that nobody wants Britain to leave the EU without a deal.He adds that there is an openness to delaying Brexit, noting the situation in London is ""somewhat chaotic"" at the moment.Varadkar repeats his call for EU leaders to cut Britain ""some slack"".""Everyone wants to avoid a no-deal but we can't have a situation whereby we have a rolling cliff-edge, where we just put off decisions and deadlines every couple of months,"" he said.""Brexit was never going to be clean. Brexit would always require some very hard choices for the United Kingdom to make. ""It was never going to be all good and no bad. And those decisions now need to be made.""**Luxembourg PM compares Brexit to Waiting for Godot**Luxembourg's prime minister Xavier Bettel says: ""I heard your speaker of parliament saying he doesn't want another vote on the \[withdrawal\] text.""I heard \[European Commission president\] Jean-Claude \[Juncker\] saying he doesn't want to reopen the vote.""So at the moment there are more non-options on the table than options ... I sometimes have the feeling that we are in the waiting room, a bit like Waiting for Godot.""But Godot never came so I hope this time they will come.""**European Parliament vice president sees path to second EU referendum**Heidi Hautala MEP, the vice president of the European Parliament, tells Sky News: ""I think it's very unlikely that today or tomorrow will bring the final agreement by the 27 to the request by the UK.""What is more likely is the 27 want to wait for what happens next week in the House of Commons.""She also suggests there could be an emergency EU summit next week to agree a longer Brexit delay, if the PM fails again to get her Brexit deal approved by MPs, but signals this would be on condition of a second EU referendum.Hautala claims a no-deal Brexit ""is not a civilised way of ending this long negotiation process"".She adds: ""I believe in that case the EU will agree on a longer extension, will propose to the UK a longer extension.""I believe very much that would be the way towards bringing this agreement to a people's vote where people would have two options: the negotiated agreement and Remain.""**Gibraltar chief minister calls for Brexit to be cancelled if PM's deal defeated again**Chief Minister of Gibraltar [FabianPicardo](https://twitter.com/FabianPicardo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) tells revocation of A50 should be on the cards: â€œIf on Tuesday MPs do not back the Withdrawal Agreement then the only way for the UK to take back control of the Brexit process is to revoke the Article 50 notificationâ€",NA,NA,b3rias,5.23E-05,-0.999895415,Against,21-03-19

206657,13,MGBricks,"Sky News can reveal that the government has taken out hundreds of gagging orders as part of its preparations for a no-deal Brexit. The orders, formerly known as non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), are legally binding contracts to stop confidential conversations being talked about in public.They are typically used to maintain secrecy around corporate deals or to protect intellectual property.However, we have discovered that the use of these NDAs has become prevalent across great swathes of the UK government.Using freedom of information requests, Sky News asked departments to reveal how many NDAs each had taken out as part of their preparations for Brexit.All responded, although not all of them actually answered the question.The Department for Transport (DfT) told us it had 79 separate NDAs by the end of February. Of these, we understand that around 50 had been signed in the preceding three months, at an average of around four per week.Although the names of those involved have obviously not been made public, we understand that the DfT's gagging orders involve hauliers, public transport companies, infrastructure operators and petrol retailers.Some told us they felt frustrated that a government ""obsession with secrecy"" had hindered constructive debate and exchange of information.The Department of Health and Social Care revealed it had taken out 24 gagging orders, while the Department for Exiting the European Union confirmed it had taken out seven.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport has fewer than five.The Home Office refused to answer the question, saying that it would be too burdensome to research the answer.However, Sky News has since confirmed that the Home Office has taken out at least 100 gagging orders, simply in relation to ports. It is unclear how many gagging orders it has in relation to the rest of its work.Chief executive of the British Ports Association, Richard Ballantyne, told us: ""Signing NDAs can disrupt the necessary flow of information with the wider logistics industry, who we often work very closely with, as well as with colleagues in Europe.""We have found it difficult to share some information that may have helped smooth preparations with ports and customs authorities in Ireland and mainland Europe, who until relatively recently had reported little direct contact with authorities in the UK on this matter.""Nine departments, including the Department of Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Education,said had not taken out any NDAs in relation to Brexit.Several others told us that the information ""was not held centrally"", while the Department for Business said that it was ""not in the public interest"" for the information to be revealed, even though the same details had been provided by every other section of government.Others, though, were more evasive. Both the Treasury and the Department for the Environment, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, told Sky News that they had signed NDAs, but refused to elaborate on the numbers they had signed.They said that it would be too burdensome to calculate, suggesting that it would take a worker more than two days of work to collate the information.We spoke to many in British business who said that Whitehall's use of these gagging orders had frustrated their Brexit plans.The Food and Drink Federation said: ""One of our frustrations throughout the process of no-deal planning has been an inconsistent approach to confidentiality across government.""Documents are often shown to us, but we're then told we cannot take them away from meetings and share them with members and more widely. This limits our ability to provide high-quality feedback.""Where NDAs have been employed this clearly creates a two-tier relationship with industry, with some businesses being insiders and others kept out of the loop. Quite apart from the practical consequences, it is no way to build trust.""Rod McKenzie, managing director of the Road Haulage Association, said that the use of non-disclosure agreements had ""hindered and frustrated"" his industry.He said: ""NDAs have been used far, far too much. It is not fair and it is simply wrong to use them in this way. They are gagging trade associations like ours from telling our members about the effect of Brexit.""I understand that government doesn't want its plans for a no-deal Brexit to end up in newspapers, but there comes a point when we have to tell our members what is actually going on, and we have been gagged from doing that on a continual basis.""The Department for Transport told Sky News: ""Good government relies on practical decisions being informed by the best advice available and requires the opportunity to make a full consideration of all the available options, without threat of premature disclosure during this live process.""The decisions involved will have wide implications for the UK, and it is absolutely vital that the process is able to proceed in a safe space, and that officials and ministers are able to have those discussions, and raise potential options and risks, necessary to fully inform the best possible policy decisions.""https://news.sky.com/story/brexit-hundreds-of-gagging-orders-taken-out-by-government-11671933",NA,NA,b3uo5j,0.003149302,-0.993701397,Against,21-03-19

The EU agree an extension for the UK if Prime Minister May can get the UK Parliament to pass her brexit deal in the next 'Meaningful Vote (MV3)' or a lengthy extension of at least 9 months or longer if she doesn't. The MV3 gets rejected and PM May decides that she is not willing to accept a lengthy extension. A no-deal brexit occurs, with the PM blaming both the EU and the UK parliament. Subsequently the UK reneges on the Â£39 billion withdrawal payment.  Here is my question. Could the EU refuse to hold any meetings regarding a subsequent Trade Agreement, possibly suing the UK (Ã  la Trump), until this issue is resolved? Leading to a sort of economic 'Cold War' between the UK and the EU, with the UK having to trade under WTO rules (including tariffs, quotas and certification issues) which must inevitably result in a drastic reduction of trade with a group of countries that were our biggest trading partners. Would this not have an economic shock to the UK equivilant to the economic depression of the 1930s and set back any Trade Agreement (which would probably take a long time to formulate even without the no-deal scenario) for at least a decade or more?
