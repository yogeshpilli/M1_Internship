The problem, as so many people have pointed out, is that no politicians honestly expected Leave to win - whichever side they campaigned for.So there was no impetus to set binding conditions on the result (i.e, a qualified majority for a change to be made), and no reason for anyone to set out a clear plan for what would happen if Leave won. So the Leave campaign was able to make grandiose promises and declarations, without having to think of *how* they would follow through on them.Similarly, the Remain campaign didn't think it needed to do much other than say how bad Leaving would be, in very stark and very dry terms. Now, May is winging it, under considerable pressure to trigger Article 50 as soon as possible. But Brexit *shouldn't* be quick.

You and other angry Brexiters seem not to understand the most basic things about this case, and indeed how the constitution of the country works.As for your petition, I couldn't care less.  Have people sign it; it makes no difference to me.  But I do find it galling when Brexiters, who (amongst other things) wanted to restore the ""sovereignty"" of the UK, its lawand its Parliament, then take issue when British law, as applied in British courts, finds that the government can't just trigger Article 50, due in large part to the sovereignty of Parliament.And yes, I suppose I am a bit full of myself.  But I've a right to be: I have read the entire High Court judgement and I will read the Supreme Court judgement(s) on the same case, along with the judgements of any other related cases as and when they are heard and decided.  In doing so, I have come and will come to understand more about the law, the constitution and our legal relationship with the European Union than a worrying number of people in this country.  Because the issues here are not actually that complex.  Constitutional law is one of the easiest areas of law to understand (at least in this layman's opinion).  It isn't necessary to read the judgement, or even parts of it; several articles have been written and several reports have been made which have very effectively conveyed the issues at law dealt with in the case.  It is therefore a shame that for so many a semblance of a proper understanding of the case and related issues seem to be beyond them.P.S.

This rate will fall to 19% for the year beginning 1 April 2017, and to 17% for the year beginning 1 April 2020.""http://taxsummaries.pwc.com/uk/taxsummaries/wwts.nsf/ID/United-Kingdom-Corporate-Taxes-on-corporate-incomeReduction of Corporation tax is done for 2 major reasons:1) To encourage the formation of small domestic businesses. Domestic businesses start out small but some can become large resulting in local employment, and sometimes patents or copyright or other income that means greater GDP and the UK becoming the home of major players that formed here. Making it easier to survive the opening years of business can result in big businesses later.2) To encourage large international businesses to stay here or to come here. If you're making millions a year then 20% down to 19% is a lot of money. As uncertainty of Brexit means many companies may consider leaving, this tax break may convince them to stay.The constant reduction from 20 down to 17 is to soften the impact of Brexit. It's expected by experts (some have had enough of experts, but those in tax planning and international trade certainly haven't) that Brexit will have a long term effect on the economy and the next decade is going to be a harder economy to thrive in.The government doesn't want to charge less tax, but small business growth and large businesses remaining are essential to GDP. Still getting all the tax but GDP falling is pointless. Better to have 17% of something than 20% of nothing.Source: I'm just some dude. Do your own research.

How the absolute hell did we get to that point? Genuine questions I'm not being a dick - why do you believe we are better off staying in the EU? I am genuinely curious.

At my old job, we did a little bit of business in Austria, France, and Switzerland. Exporting to Switzerland was a *massive* pain in the arse, due to the extra taxes and regulations involved. Deliveries to EU members were as simple as delivering to an address in the UK.Has the EU ever directly and *personally* impacted you in a negative way? Have you ever been prevented from doing something, or been forced to do something you didn't want to, in a way that is directly attributable to the EU?Oh yawn. Nobody believes the UK is 'worthless' outside of the EU. We just believe our ability to trade, travel and work is dramatically increased being part of it. When 44% of our trade involves the EU, but we only account for around 12% of the EU's trade, it's hardly hyperbole to say that leaving would probably be a bad thing for our economy.I notice below that you have pointed to our economy's lack of collapse since June 23rd.

Fuck it I'll happily sort a visa out. Their imposed currency is a failure on other countries causing bankruptcy and mass unemployment over the years and open borders and mass immigration is an absolute nightmare (I live in a city that has taken in the 2nd highest amount of Syrian migrants, most of them groups of men, it's no joke believe me it's causing so many problems) but that's another subject entirely!

I've seen friends have relationships destroyed, their careers dragged down, and their lives severely disrupted due to the restrictions placed on them by immigration laws, both here and abroad. The freedom of movement we enjoy in the EU is incredible, and it makes me desperately sad to consider my life without it. To be blunt, I don't agree.

13095,4,abbyreedere,"London Tech Chief Urge Post-Brexit Plan to UK London's standing as Europe's leading destination for tech start-ups is at risk if the British government does not clarify how it plans to keep the best technical talent, entrepreneurs and investors have warned. In an open letter to Prime Minister Theresa May, nine major UK-based technology entrepreneurs and investors, including Niklas Zennstrom, Skype co-founder, pressed the government to step to guarantee a continued abundance of experienced migrants after UK drops the EU. It also called on the government to address EU market access and other concerns. The No. 1 issue for entrepreneurs post-Brexit is admission to talent, in specific technical talent. It was dated Dec. 6 and timed to correspond with the yearly TechCrunch Disrupt London conference for start-ups and investors. Allotments on particular ability could harshly narrow the ability of new tech firms to increase.The letter calls on the government to push for connection to the European Union's virtual single market and to guarantee a simple and competitive framework for firms, labor, tax, stock options and bankruptcy security. Zennstrom said at TechCrunch, ""what the UK government needs to make sure is that technology companies still have access to the best talent in the world. If (that happens) without a lot of red tape, we are going to be fine"". Paris and Berlin are striving to expel London's advantage in the European start-up scene, while other cities including Dublin, Amsterdam and Frankfurt are also advocating themselves as alternative tech hubs in the face of Brexit skepticism. In fintech, a sector where London positions as a global head, funding for UK firms has diminished since UKâ€™s vote in June to leave the EU. Germany's rival fintech scene has captured 35 percent more venture capital funding than Britain in the last two quarters, according to a report by KPMG and CBInsights.The British government has put forward a number of initiatives to support the tech sector, such as providing funding for more fiber-optic broadband and committing to boost investment through the British Business Bank to replace potentially lost EU funding. It has showed off plans by U.S. tech giants Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple to generate new stations in London and employ additional crew as a method of confidence in the UK market. But it has so far prevented creating commitments to ensure a continued flow of technically skilled migrants into UK.Reference: https://www.ttm.news/2016/12/18/london-tech-chief-urge-post-brexit-plan-uk/",NA,NA,5j2e1a,1.60E-12,-1,Against,18-12-16

However, keep in mind that the EU is not a single country, so every member has something to say (""sovereignty."")Whenever EU does trade deals, we leave the ""easy 4-year bilateral trade deals"" and we enter the ""complicated multilateral free-trade agreements"". A good example might be the ""Commonwealth of Independent States Free Trade Area"" which took from 1991 to 2011.Most other mulit-nation agreements had decades with partly successful predecessors and often have histories like ""The organisation was founded in 1967, collapsed in 1977, and revived on 7 July 2000.""So, yes, EU is as slow as any other multi-national project.

13183,4,SirJoePininfarina,"The UK's unique, unwritten constitutional setup means that parliament is sovereign whereas a vote by the people is not. Such a vote can be given legal power through an act of parliament i.e. the act that created the EU referendum gives the government the right to negotiate to leave the EU and go ahead and leave the EU. What the vote is not, however, is indefatigable. That is to say that if parliament wills it, a UK government's plan to proceed with Brexit can be stopped at any stage prior to the UK actually legally leaving the EU. There is no requirement to have another referendum to overturn such a decision; furthermore, if the Lib Dems, by some miracle, got elected into government, they could decide not to proceed with Brexit entirely and they could not be forced to (bar parliamentary shenanigans to obstruct any other business).Compare this to, for example, Ireland; we had votes on EU topics more than once because with us, our written constitution places sovereignty in the people and means that if we state our wish in a referendum, it is indefatigable - unless we're asked again and give a different answer. It seemed ludicrous for us to have a second referendum on the Nice Treaty but the reality was if we said No a second time, we'd be pretty much obliged to leave the EU as our government no longer had a mandate to be in an EU under such a treaty and the EU wasn't going to throw out the Treaty of Nice just for the sake of a small, peripheral country.  (Furthermore, like the UK's EU referendum, most if not all of our EU-related referendums have acted as a barometer for the government of the day rather than a genuine answer to a question on a ballot paper.)Anyway, the bottom line is that Brexit can be stopped as long as Britain is in the EU because otherwise the only way it could be undone would be for Britain to join the EU and we all know that won't happen in our lifetimes (not least because all new members must join the euro!)If I were a British voter, especially one that voted Remain, I would demand that the divorce deal is better than the current arrangement for Britain. If it's not, then I would demand things not change.

13231,4,_Waygo_,"Change Britain's New 'Report' claiming Â£450 million can be saved with a 'hard' Brexit I just had to find somewhere to rant about this. Suffice it to say that my job/colleagues leave me unable to do so in the office, and on social media under my own name I try to maintain an objective, neutral perspective. This aims to be a fairly neutral rant, but if the case for one side is so overwhelming then I think that it is entirely fair to be neutral but still support a conclusion.The subject of this post is the following [report](https://www.changebritain.org/leave-eus-single-market-customs-union-boost-uk-450-million-week/) which makes the claim that the UK can save Â£450m per week via a 'hard' Brexit, or Â£24bn per year. I have so many problems with the methods used that I barely know where to begin.Because all arguments on this topic veer rapidly into *ad-hominem*, I should say that although I voted to remain during the referendum, having lost the vote I believe that if possible we should trigger Article 50 as early as we can in 2017, despite my various misgivings. If we can't make the Article 50 trigger work in 2017 then perhaps a re-think will be due.Moving on from this to the critique, the report contains three sections. In the first, figures are used which show how much the UK could regain from EU budget contributions. These are hard to dispute, although I would note that they do not account for some of the benefits received in return, from EHICs to regulatory input etc.. Still, this is an old debate that was done to death during the referendum.The second section uses figures from Open Europe, a reputable group, which are again difficult to argue with. The third section, however, is where things go totally barmy. This section covers new trade agreements which could be signed between the UK and other states and groups of states. Based on trade deals being signed with a mixture of Mercosur, China, India and others who have signaled that they 'would be willing to do a trade deal with the UK', the authors have calculated a low/high/likely trade dividend from a 'hard' or 'clean' Brexit of Â£8.5/19.8/12.3bn.Despite all the technocratic jargon though, there is no indication from these countries that they would prioritize these agreements with the UK over competing priorities; it is impossible to tell how long they would take to negotiate (potentially a decade or more). Nor is there any indication about whether they would be willing to provide us with better, worse or the same terms that they would provide to the EU, which is already well into negotiations with some of these states (and in the case of Korea has already completed an agreement which has been in force since 2011). The methodology is based on taking the EU's own forecasts detailing what these trade agreements could contribute by way of exports to the EU's entire economy, then taking a proportion of this equal to the proportion of EU trade which is accounted for by the UK. Upon separating with the EU, I can almost guarantee that this figure would quickly come to be seen as laughable - I have never seen a forecasting method like it. It completely fails to account for any exporters leaving the UK for other countries, or for a race to the bottom in corporate/income taxes between the UK and EU resulting in a loss of revenue, or for any shift in the balance of trade between the UK and EU after the UK departs. Above all else it treats export figures as being the same as government revenue (from the EU budget) and as being the same as savings to UK businesses from reduced regulation. In terms of some sort of Keynesian aggregate demand this may be the case, but that is only a fraction of the real economic picture and even if correct it does not necessarily mean that 1.) the government will be better off, 2.) UK private companies will be better off, 3.) the average man on the street will be better off. This is because at its core, this piece of work assumes that there will be no net cost to Britain leaving the EU, and this is plainly daft. As a summary of the **gross** benefits which could accrue to the UK, it is only the figure attributed to trade (which makes up nearly half of the total asserted benefit) that makes the thing bat-shit insane. But as a PR stunt being promoted as a factual estimate of the **net** figures it is the wildest fantasy that I have yet seen in a policy debate which has been almost completely devoid of all economic reason and common sense.P.S: In five years time, if things turn out much better than I expect, people who still insist that they are not 'metropolitan elites' (or, more factually, that they are not 'liberal' members of such an elite) will parade around saying that this figure has been realised, and the UK is Â£24bn better off. And as always, they will refer to nominal figures (not adjusted for inflation or the 20% fall in the value of GBP), and thus it will be a lie.",NA,NA,5knh1d,1.00E-08,-0.99999998,Against,28-12-16

13314,4,Mwask,"Brexit the illusion of control. A point of view from industry. I spoke with Aerospace companies recently about the direct impact of Brexit. Put simply by one of the directors ""if your not sitting at the table, your on the menu"".  I thought that was a nice/macabre analogy. I'm however looking for the silver lining in Brexit, Britain will recover and prosper, but how it guides itself through that I'm yet to understand. The aerospace chaps offered some insight into how businesses are thinking. Apart from the sourcing of labour. A big concern was time and compliance. The physical moving of goods between enforced borders of Europe and the U.K.  Calais/Dover is woefully unprepared for such time consuming checks of goods, the technology necessary, people power, nor physical capacity. Nor are businesses prepared with systems in place to process documentation and regulation that will come with hard borders. All of the above can be solved with time and investment. I understand by 2019 we theoretically should be outside the EU. To modernise and invest in a 21st century port compliant with the nuanced task of moving 1000s of tons of goods daily, I believe would take much longer and we haven't even started this process.Secondly, compliance. Some argued during the referendum we would become unburdened by lengthy, intrusive and obstructive EU directives, quangos and legislation. However, the cruel reality is to continue trading with the EU you must comply with their regulations. For example I'm selling your domestic airline company tires. In order to do so, I must satisfy the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). If the UK or British business does not like compliance with EASA then that domestic airline will purchase tires from elsewhere. Not to mention British Government would have to rebuild the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and essentially emulate the EU's EASA anyway because it wants to continue trading with the EU and the rest of the world and therefore must comply. This goes back to the earlier analogy, we are no longer sitting at the table deciding what's on the menu (what the rules are) therefore we become an item in the menu wholly anchored to comply with EU regulation in order to continue trading. Therefore we have the illusion of taking back control, but in fact we have lost a seat at the decision making table. I would hasten to add in summary that all of this is not apocalyptic, solutions can and will be found. I'm interested in your thoughts regarding the concept of control and how much of it ultimately the U.K. can possibly hope for today. ",NA,NA,5m0pqh,2.82E-06,-0.999994357,Against,04-01-17

Without these regulations smaller companies will thrive as at the moment they cannot compete with the larger companies who have dedicated teams of people to keep up to date with regulations.Just if you were looking for a silver lining.,dc0anig,5m0pqh,5m0pqh,0.528267003,0.056534006,Neutral,05-01-17

13325,4,digitalassassins,"Yes they do have to follow EU regulation to sell to companies,  but you seem to forget,  those companies that are selling aviation tyres even to companies inthe UK already have to follow EU regulations to sell within the UK market aswell..  So if they want to sell to Europe they just need to keep up standatds to sell to Europe..Here is an example,  a sweet manufacturer wants to start up in the UK, it's their dream.. But he will have to follow thousands of regulations ,  testing and have teams of people legally and scientifically to help with following EU legislation and directives,  to get their products ready for the European market.  Even if they only want to sell in the UK. Its probably not financially possible to start small.. If we remove lots of unnecessary directives and legislation,  these sweet manufacturers will be able to start small without being strangled with legislation to just sell to the UK market..  Lets say This company make 10 million in the first 2 year (they are doing really well) they then hire legal and scientific teams to help with the task of following EU legislation, we now have an international company helping our economy.. Over Legislation and regulation strangles small businesses.  Legislation is required to protect peoples health and safety but over regulation  is used to protect big business and strangle competition.  The only problem you have is if businesses end up big,  then push for higher regulation and burn bridges for smaller businesses following their footsteps (protectionism) you end up with lack of innovation and stagnation in the market..

Projects inside the UK are similar.Almost everybody is working project-based and they are switching clients every 6-12 months anyhow. So they are used to traveling around and switching environments. The company is paying for travel expenses and housing. They get fully equipped apartments from the company. So all they do is say to HR that the next project should be inside EU and not UK. If HR fails to fulfill this they send out application to other EU based IT Consulting Companies and switch. A lot of are applying already while still in projects in preparation HR will not meet their demands.The market is booming and the other companies are more then happy to take them and even give them more $$$.People are earning quite a lot of money from an Manager position above. So getting ~5-10 cents less for one â‚¬ (which is already happening now) can add up to an sum equal to 1 Tesla at the end of the year.

Itâ€™s not going to happen, guys!   And indeed how could it?   HOW COULD IT?

The discussions seem to concentrate on two themes; why do I mention xenophobia and why am I worried when nothing has been decided yet.One of the outcomes of the referendum is that it has become common for Europeans to be asked why they came to Britain. We used to be brethren, now somehow I need to explain what I am doing here. I wouldn't ask the Englishman living in my parents' street what he is doing there, would I? To top it up; people we have been friends with for years for no reason fail to invite us for parties. Maybe they try to protect us from less savoury friends that they do invite?A second element of the feedback is that no political decisions have been made yet; why do I worry? Well, to mention just a few; my British plus Dutch pension rights are going to be a right mess, I have no established NGO to advice and support me if I need it. Already my daughter had fewer rights to education then native children. Will she be able to qualify for Right to Buy schemes? Are we guaranteed access to the NHS?

Neither the people who voted leave or remain would want this [the majority of people at least].What's happening is that you're perpetuating a hysteria over something which hasn't happened, and the threat of which is likely never going to happen either.I know EU nationals who voted to leave the EU and I know some who voted to stay. I honestly believe the majority of instances is of 'hate crime' is actually someone making shit up to grow their victimhood. We've seen it in the US recently since Trump was elected people pretending to be beaten up and harassed when they did it to themselves to play a victim card. Because in modern society people are more concerned about being a victim and someone with a label, than actually facing teh reality which isn't as bad as they're suggesting.Don't misunderstand me though, I couldn't possibly say that you are lying, or that your partner is lying either. And I'm not SUGGESTING it either.But you must be aware, that when it comes to playing the victim, people are all too eager to start making shit up on the fly and it happens on both sides of what you voted in the referendum. For example people make shit up about immigrants to fuel their fire. Likewise from the remain camp we see people faking hate crime to make anyone that voted leave look like a scumbag bigot.The reality is, it isn't that bad on either side. People are just liable to hyperbolate things given how relevant the EU/NON-EU subject is in day to day conversation.And also, ask yourself the question, because what you are eluding to with your statement, it feels like you're suggesting the majority of the leave voters agree with this person who insulted your girlfriend. When the reality is, they don't. And even if they did agree, they wouldn't be so rude and callous as to call someone out in public to do it. We know this to be fact, this is England, this is the reason the leave vote took everyone be suprise, because the majority of the voters, are actually silent and keep to themselves. So to suggest the leave vote is the reason for this hate crime is actually a diversion from the truth anyway. *It's not that leave voters finally have some sort of reason to start being total cunts, it's that those people committing any hatecrime are just cunts anyway, and the EU referendum is just the vehicle THEY are using to justify it. It's not the other way around.* And surely you must know that. And if you DO know that, then you know it's not as bad as the MSM and others are making it out to be. THEY are the ones making EU nationals have a fear of this situation. The fear actually doesn't arrive out of anything that has been said officially. It's all fed by the media. Remember that negative emotions are more powerful than positive ones. The media know this all too well.Do not be played my good sir.",dc9nbsr,dc8ngec,5ml25t,0.991621479,0.983242958,Brexit,11-01-17

Of course, the countries where most people meeting this description come from are already outside the EU (notable exceptions being Balkan Muslims) and therefore not entitled to the so-called free movement allowed within the EU. Even if one was concerned with, say, German Muslims, why would one be more concerned with them, than British- or American-born Muslims?I suppose there is an overblown concern that especially amongst Syrian refugees being accepted into continental EU countries, there exists a small number of violent extremists, and that, in time, such individuals may acquire citizenship of their host country, and in turn, be able to enter the UK as easily as someone native-born to that country, with the intent of committing violent crime within the UK.Finally, post-referendum, it would appear some have interpreted the result as legitimising anti-foreign feelings - resulting in individuals dressed in non-western clothing, having a non-native accent, or speaking a language other than English amongst friends and family in public being increasingly the victim of harassment - even if they are from groups not known for being victims of such, e.g. Canadians, Americans, Swedes...

13725,4,despairing_koala,"First my markets/ economic reasons:Once the IK is out of the EU, manufacturers and service providers will no longer be able to rely on the principle of mutual recognition. Mutual recognition means that if a company in,say, Finland produces a new type of food or a new gadget, they can immediately put it on the market in, for example, France.  All EU Member States have to assume that products produced in another Member State or services provided will be of an acceptable standard and must be considered to be legal and ready to go. A manufacturer from outside of the EU has to prove that their products meet the minimum EU standard. That's easy enough for big multinationals to achieve, but places a really big onus on small producers or service providers. There is a good chance that it will no longer be financially viable for them to export to the EU which reduces the potential markets accessible to them, especially markets which are close by and therefore easier from a transport/logistics perspective. Leaving the customs union also means that every single lorry load of potatoes going from England to France or vice versa has to clear customs. This adds cost, because it takes time, and at present we don't have the infrastructure to do so. Who will pick up these costs? The consumer, because supermarkets or farmers definitely won't. So prices will rise. You know how US sweets or cereals are really expensive compared to European stuff? Customs costs are one important reason for this. These points, together with the whole ""strength in numbers"" argument (why should the US offer as a good trade deal? They don't need it, we do as our previous partners are no longer freely available, oops)  means that I am convinced that the UK economy will tank. And that's when government can start to take even more pieces out of the welfare/workers' rights/environmental protection/NHS provisions that we currently enjoy. I'm an EU national who has been in this country for 25 years. My partner is from another EU state and has been here for over 10 years. We both have unlimited leave to remain, and we also speak enough other EU languages to work in six countries (me) or four countries (him) without any problems. We are both experts in our fields and will be welcome anywhere. It doesn't really affect us. But the lesser qualified non foreign speakers are now basically fucked.

13759,4,hebe1983,"Brexit is bad because it has been a political shitshow from the beginning and it is deeply dividing the UK.As a French living in the UK, obviously I would prefer the UK to stay in the UE but I would also recognise the UK people's prerogative to leave the UK after an informed referendum. That's democracy.The problem is, the vote wasn't informed. First, the british media coverage of UE affairs has also been terrible. Even if you don't count the tradition of blatant and palatable lies about the UE initiated by Boris Johnson when he was the Telegraph's correspondent in Brussels, the coverage is not good. I get that UE affairs are complex and dry, and I can't think of a single european country whose media is actually doing a good job on EU... but the UK was amongst the worst.Then, you've got the referendum campaign. You could have hoped that the campaign would have been the occasion to actually explain how the UE works to the public, that there would be some advantages to leave, that there would be some inconvenient, etc. You can always debate on whether the advantages are worth the inconvenient, on how to manage to limit the inconvenient, etc. There was plenty to discuss so the people could cast an informed vote. Obviously, that's not what happened. The Leave campaign shouted ""project fear"" at any mention of a negative impact of Brexit and spouted obvious lies such as the Â£350 millions for the NHS. And the Remain campaign wasn't much better as it was split between a very weak promotion of EU benefits and a focus on potentially disastrous consequences of Brexit. Add to that the fact that the debate on immigration turned into a shouting match about racism, and you've got a campaign that was about anything but the reality of Brexit.So, not surprisingly, the result of the referendum was completely uninformed. The very fact that the UK public discovered the existence of article 50 on the day after the referendum is quite telling (as illustrated by [Google Trends](https://www.google.fr/trends/explore?date=2016-06-01%202016-06-30&amp;q=article%2050)). Basically, they were told they could win a Grand Prix and discovered after voting that they didn't even know how to start the car.And then, we come to the actual Brexit process. After a good and democratic campaign, the public would have been informed that Brexit would be difficult and the fact that they would have still voted for it would have meant that they accepted it. The fact is, it wasn't a good and democratic campaign... which means that the public didn't expect any difficulties. So obviously if something's wrong, it's not because they made an uninformed choice, it's because the other side is sabotaging the process... and obviously, the government doesn't have the courage to admit that the public wasn't informed (because that would be massively unpopular) so they perpetuate the idea that everything will be fine. And from there, it's a headlong rush: if something's wrong, it's because the Brexit isn't ""hard"" enough. Even though the immediate exit of the UE (as morons like Michael Gove or UKIP ask for) would have immediate and disastrous  consequences for the UK economy, they're still asking for it because they can't admit that they sold rubbish.So, now, the Remainers and the Leavers are even more polarised. The Leavers are even more convinced that leaving as soon as possible is necessary and Remainers are even more convinced that leaving is a bad idea. This is a huge problem as both sides can't rationally talk to each other and that makes the country politically unstable.TL;DR: Brexit was not necessarily a bad idea but, given the political circonstances and the terrible level of debate during the campaign, it has turned the UK into a political shitshow.

13803,4,fedepiz,"I preface by saying that I am a EU citizen currently doing a PhD in the UK, and I am biased towards remain for obvious, selfish reasonsTo my observation, there seems to be three primary arguments for Brexit: the free trade argument, the sovereignty argument, and the immigration argument. There are of course overlaps between these, but I believe this to be a fair categorization - although I do not claim it to be comprehensive.--The free trade argument goes like this: there are some downsides in being within the European Single Market: while members gain the ability to trade tariff-free, it also means there is a large amount of red tape required to keep this bureaucratic machinery working. And since the rules needs to be derived by common agreement between member states, this means that usually a compromise solution is necessary, which is by definition sub-optimal. Proponents of brexit on free trading grounds argue that, being freed by the shackles of the EU, the UK will be in a position to negotiate much better bilateral deals, both with the EU and the rest of the world. On the other hand opponents argue that a UK outside the EU is in a weaker position, and therefore will not be able to conclude bilateral agreements which are  better then the current intra-EU compromise solution.--The sovereignty argument criticizes the fact that EU law has an influence on the members' laws. This fact is seen as a negative by all those who want the British Government/Parliament as the ultimate ruling authorities in the UK, and feel that EU lawmakers are, in some sense, infringing over the freedom of the country (This is the very reason motivating UKIP's name). People holding this view also generally believe that the original role of the EU was not to attempt to converge towards a tight federation, but rather be mostly a free trading block. By implementing Brexit, they seek to change much of the EU-inspired legislation, which is only to increase if the federalist trend continues. Moreover, the UK would no longer need to pay in membership fees, and would be free to allocate that money for other, domestic projects (whether this is worth the cost of the Brexit process is not clear).Opponents to this idea usually argue by either declaring support for the EU's federalist project (although I find that to be quite rare in the UK), or by stating that the EU's infringements of UK's sovereignty are at worst minor annoyances.--The immigration argument. I feel this is the most contentious topic, and definitely the one that has, sometimes, turned the discussion into a bit of a shouting match. Supporters of the immigration argument for Brexit will say that leaving the EU is necessary in order to control migration of EU nationals to the UK, primarily in order to combat the perceived wage depression that the current rates of migrations are supposed to bring, and avoid a housing and service shortage. Note that the UK, not being part of the Schengen's agreements, is still able to monitor its frontiers, with entry not being guaranteed for non-EU nationals coming from an EU country - so those that voted Brexit in order to keep out middle-eastern refugees or other non-EU migrants have unfortunately cast their vote under false assumptions. Opponents of this idea suggest that the currents rates of migration are beneficial to the UK economy, and that there is more to be lost by implementing stricter border policies.Some people have pointed out the existence of a widespread xenophobic sentiment being present in the British population. For what is worth this is in utter contrast with my personal experience, as I have always felt very welcome in the UK and do not believe a majority of leave voters hold such views.A lot of what actually is to happen on each of these points depends exactly on what will be the result of the UK-EU negotiations. Until such time, Brexit is a big unknown - I personally believe the outcomes could range from a glorious, shiny future for a stronger, independent UK to an utter catastrophe, with a UK significantly weakened on the international stage and unable to exert sufficient influence to take advantages of the newly gained freedom.TLDR: The benefits and costs will depend on how the negotiations go!",dckgz91,5olxn7,5olxn7,4.25E-07,-0.999999151,Against,18-01-17

Not because of the EU, but because of successive poor governments, one after another.ECONOMY: Sure, our economy looks good on paper, but that's because of the sheer amount of trade we do with the EU, which is the 2nd largest economy in the entire world. Yes, more than China. If you cut that away, it instantly halves itself on both sides and we're left cold-calling all the other countries in the world individually, trying to offer them a better deal than the EU can. Spoiler alert: We can't offer them better deals because we can't afford to. We have an almost insurmountable debt (not because of the EU) so we need all the help we can get.IMMIGRATION: Let's not lie, here. Immigration was the biggest driving factor for voting to leave the EU for the vast majority of Leave voters. Yes, it was. No no no - don't you dare make excuses for them. YES, it was. The fallout immediately after the referendum, the constant talking about it in the news and the media - hell, even down to the ""bio"" information on people's individual twitter and facebook profiles - immigration was a huge factor, here. But leaving the EU will only mildly reduce the amount of migrants we receive, and vastly increase bureaucracy and difficulty in letting UK-born people travel anywhere within the EU. EU migration is still the minority of our incoming migrants by far, and EU nationals make up a mere 5% of the UK population. Besides, they'll still come to live here even if we leave the EU. Most of them will be allowed in because the biggest chunk of the pie chart are people ""qualified"" to come to the UK based on the fact that they meet points requirements anyway, or have a job waiting for them. Non-EU migration will likely remain unaffected, but we're going to have far less people coming here to study and paying our universities the metric fuck-ton that they do. That's bad for our economy and our Universities. Very bad.EDUCATION: We're fucked. We can barely run our own schools, let alone the NHS or our prisons, and cutting off funding and help from the EU is just going to make all of that a lot worse.SOVEREIGNTY: We have sovereignty. I have no idea where all these Leavers got the idea that we don't have sovereignty so long as we're in the EU, because that's flat out wrong (Besides, the process by which EU produces laws is actually MORE democratic than the UK's government). In the UK, we have control over most of our laws, we have a Queen, we have a Prime Minister and we have a fully-elected Parliament who pass laws and decline laws all the time. EU Law serves only to regulate, and in my opinion, EU Laws have done massive favours for poor, working-class and middle-class people everywhere. They make sure our food is a good quality, they make sure we're paid properly and have a nice big pile of rights to keep us safe and guard us from unfair treatment from the plutocrats. Leaving the EU strips most of these rights and regulations away, meaning the absolute richest of us will be the only ones benefiting, because they can have the Tories rework the laws in their favour.Honestly, I feel like many Leave voters have been conned. You were brainwashed into voting for the option that best suits Rupert Murdoch and his cronies. I believe that there's still a good chunk of Leave voters who voted because they genuinely thought that it was what was best for themselves, but you have voted Britain into a future that will do nothing to help our poor, our NHS or our young - three things that are currently in an absolute mess due to the actions of our far-right government.

According to most business leaders and economists we 100% would have to get a better deal if we want to end up better off, especially in the short term.This is dictated by basic ecenomic theory. If the price of goods/services goes up the demand falls that's just fact. Sure in the long run we might do better if we manage to sign free trade agreements with other countries and boost our exports or reduce our corporate taxation to attracts business investment but this wouldn't be for at least 10+ years. The EU is made up of many smaller independent states that will each have their balance of trade affected by Brexit differently. It's important to remember though that each of these states will still have 26 other countries it can trade freely with to replace any lost imports or exports with Britian. As GDP is determined by C+I+G+(EX-IM) any reduction in exports(EX) to the UK from the EU can be easily replaced by (C) domestic consumption or (EX) by being exported to other EU states depending how you want to look at it. Any reduction in (IM) imports from the UK can also be more easily replaced by (C) or imports(IM)from other EU states which would actually contribute to the EU GDP or at least soften the ecenomic blow of brexit substantially. The UK on the other hand won't have any countries to replace it's lost exports(EX)in the short term. We will also see a reduction in (I) investment due to market uncertainty and reducing migration plus we will still import(IM) a huge amount from the EU as the majority are high value products not purchased for the low costs that the uk can't produce itself, or foods we love but can't grow. The UKs largest exports(EX)to the EU are aerospace with most of the industry being employed by airbus which is a European company. Pharmaceuticals which will potentially see a reduction in if we don't follow EU laws or standards. Car manufacturing which is entirly dependent on trade with Europe as part of the supply chain and as a destination for 80% of production. As these goods are all high value and price inelastic and require substancial sunk costs to produce Any short term fall in the value of the Â£ is unlikely to increase trade in any of these vital sectors. All these factors will have a negative impact on the UK GDP. Tldr. You can support brexit but from an ecenomic standpoint we are at a huge disadvantage entering these negotiations. Any advantage from leaving is decades away and we are likely to have a really stagnant decade of growth(again) in the meantime. The EU is also far more protected from a very hard brexit than the UK due to existing trading partners. ",dclr7ve,dckzi2g,5oo4s7,2.66E-13,-1,Against,18-01-17

13937,4,SamSchpasm,"Do you agree with the results of the poll? The way the question is phrased is deeply flawed in my opinion.Everything I've seen, read, and heard since the referendum suggests that immigration was the number one issue. We need to move away from pretending otherwise to protect the legitimacy of Leave voters, and move towards accepting that a vote cast to control immigration was ITSELF legitimate.Exactly with Trump, it is very likely that racists voted to Leave, but its infantile to say most Leavers voted the way they did because they're racist. The vast majority of Leave voters I've encountered voted for change, and to protect or enhance their own prospects. Plenty of demographics have come out since the referendum - older, poorer, less educated people voted Leave, younger, wealthier, better educated people voted Remain. North/South divide. It seems to me that the common denominators here are happiness and a sense of control over one's life. If you had them, you probably voted Remain. If you didn't, you probably voted Leave.Immigration is a legitimate concern. Here, and across Europe. Identity politics is degrading the debate. It is possible to be centrist or left-wing, and still believe that immigration levels are too high, just as its possible to be right-wing and try to get as many people into the country as possible (as the Tory government, under May's watchful eye, has proven over the past few years).",dcnwv21,dckhcr2,5olxn7,0.005144887,-0.989710226,Against,20-01-17

13942,4,PM_ME_HKT_PUFFIES,"I'm pretty close to this subject.I work within the NHS, and I have a business outside, that employs 12 people.Under Tory rule, the hospital I work in has gone from one relatively efficient business to 12 grossly inefficient.The hospital itself was sold to a management company owned by the secretary for health. Each department was then sold off to the highest bidder. X-ray, the wards, A+E, Orthodaedics, security, ENT etc etc. Each owned by a different trust. This is the privatisation we are talking about.So the problem is that now each one of those departments has an admin office, filled with a management structure. So the hospital has gone from one management office, to 12.And to make matters worse, if A+E want an x-ray done, they get charged an exorbitant rate because X-Ray is now owned by a competitor trust who have no interest in keeping prices low for a competitor. So, A+E have to build their own X-Ray room. Our hospital now has 3 different X-Ray departments because ""competition"".Privatisation isn't working. It's sucking up funds by getting blown on infrastructure and management, and so patient services are suffering. Queues getting longer, expensive operations like heart ops etc getting shut down altogether.The tories tell us they are spending more money. Well, they are putting Â£10bn in to cover until 2020. What they don't tell you is the Â£59bn they took out of the back door during austerity.What they don't tell you is the massive defunding of (for example) local councils who provide the home services. Home services provide support for people who leave hospital. Let's say an old lady breaks a leg from a fall. This can mean a period of hospital time between 6-12 weeks convalescing. When she leaves hospital she is weaker and unable to easily stand up or do household duties.Home services train her up to a point where she is fit enough to cope on her own.. this can take months and months.This is the same for most elderly people coming out of hospital, but also younger people post heart ops, stroke victims etc etc.By defunding home services (which is strangely not NHS) to the tune of hundreds of millions, there is now a massive backlog of people waiting to go home. These people taking up beds that the system is feeding in, making operation wait times lengthen, and pressurising A+E departments at the front end.This is NHS defunding via the back door.David Cameron told us that ""Front Line services will be ringfenced"" against cuts. Yet, between 2010 and 2016, 144 A+E departments were permanently closed.---------I employ 10-12 staff on a permanent basis, and occasionally have to recruit several more temporary staff on a seasonal basis, usually for several months.These temporary staff are employed at basic rate (although I give a good financial bonus when I let them go) so the job is advertised as minimum wage.The breakdown of job applicants are: Eastern Europeans who really want the job. They tell me they already work evenings cleaning etc and have a family to support.British born mums, looking for extra income for holiday/wedding/car.I also get British born guys. They have been sent by the job centre and they are listless. They have zero motivation, and list gaming as their outside activity. If I offer them the job, they turn up for at best the first week, then become unreliable, then uncontactable. For some reason British born girls don't apply for the jobs.So in my case, no, Eastern Europeans aren't taking jobs from British born. If (thanks to Brexit) there are no more Eastern European people applying for the jobs, I'll stop that line of products and just stick to regular business. It's a shame because that's several families not earning, paying taxes, and will probably go onto govt support. It's fewer products in the shops, and existing products will go up in price because we all have to make a living.Fuck Brexit, and particularly fuck the Tories who desperately want to see an end to the NHS.",dcnzwmu,dcmloay,5ow0xl,0.999996198,0.999992395,Brexit,20-01-17

The truth is, the British economy has evolved beyond its homegrown means, and isn't sustainable without high levels of migration. This may well have an adverse affect on quality of life and opportunities for low-skilled Britons in particular, but the root cause is an education system that has failed, and an inability to shake off a culture of superiority and complacency.Brexit and the movement behind it is based on ""sticking-plaster politics"" - it doesn't address the primary issues at their root, but seeks to scapegoat others and provide narrow, short-sighted solutions that will only last so long. Not a single policy has come out of the Tory government since 23rd June deliberately setting out to bridge the divide between those who have kept pace with modern Britain, and those who have been left behind. Politicians on every side are doing their utmost to profit from the chaos, without giving half a shit for the people who will really be hurt by Brexit.Leaving the European Union wasn't my choice, but it isn't doomed to failure in itself - there is a version of this that could play out with Britain doing well for itself. Unfortunately, Brexit has put all of the power into the hands of people who not only cannot deliver this version of events, but don't even want to. Theresa May being an advocate for ending immigration, when she didn't bat an eyelid at the Tory target of 100,000 being ripped apart on her watch, says it all really.

13994,4,SamSchpasm,"Hang on, I don't remember being given any say on ID cards. The government retreated due to pressure from the media masquerading as the public, not the actual public. The fact that the proposal has come along twice suggests that it will come along again and again because there is a vested interest somewhere in getting them through. I suspect it's all about timing - make the proposal following the next terrorist attack, and get the Daily Mail on side, and we might find ""public opinion"" has shifted somewhat...The majority of the public don't understand how or why certain laws or regulations come in. Until we take the House of Lords out of our own lawmaking procedures, we can hardly complain about the undemocratic EU... Most people aren't that engaged in politics. They probably watch one news programme, read one newspaper, and have one circle of friends, who all share the same opinions. They might not like the concept of having European lawmakers, especially when the case against is dripping in xenophobic language as it was during the campaign, but in practice they couldn't give you an example (other than on immigration), because they have no way of differentiating between EU made and UK made laws.Freedom of movement is a tenet of the EU - one of the few things about the EU that everyone knows. However, were the public made aware just how catastrophically the Tory government had failed to keep non-EU migration down to a sensible level? Did the public know that, under EU law, the British government could already remove EU migrants who hadn't found work in three months? No. They read the immigration headlines, and they connected it with the lack of control they felt in their own lives, and they took the bait.Maybe you're right, and I'm not giving the British public enough credit. Regardless, people will soon find out what it means to have sovereignty, over immigration and everything else, and I think it will very quickly become clear that they've traded a European system that ignores them for a British one that ignores them. A five minute glance at our economy shows that it cannot survive without high levels of immigration - the Tories have absolutely no interest in significantly reducing the numbers - they just need to placate the public with lies, misdirection, and probably another shit policy to increase the number of apprenticeships...",dcphfcl,dcp0efs,5olxn7,0.997137785,0.994275571,Brexit,21-01-17

Case in point... the Murdoch press endorsed the SNP - clearly that does not reflect Rupert's actual view.The European parliament makes laws. The HoL does not. It quality-controls laws made by the HoC (proposing amendments that the HoC has no obligation to accept) and actually enhances our democracy by only being able to block laws that have not been voted on by the public (that is to say it can only veto laws not included in the gov't's manifesto at the time of its election).I think so. That information is readily available - even in the media that you deride. Although not everyone will have taken it in and that may have been your point! And being able to remove out-of-work EU migrants is a red herring as they are neither 'stealing jobs' nor do they have full access to the welfare state - plus they are a small minority.Steady on!

13998,4,SamSchpasm,"Polling isn't a tool for measuring public opinion, it's a tool for directing public opinion. If the Daily Express and The Guardian both ran a poll to determine public opinion on capital punishment, I think we'd get two very different results. Both would report overwhelming public assent for their respective, opposite causes.Maybe I'm being too harsh on the public, but in modern politics, I'm inclined to believe that people are far more likely to get their opinions from media (whether that's through mainstream media like a newspaper, or a political movement like Momentum or Leave.EU), than for these media movements to form their politics based on public opinion. People are being told what to believe - the incentive for going along with it is that you can then be part of a particular, exclusive club. This can readily be seen by the current trend of labelling other ""tribes"" as a way to denigrate them. Brexiteers. Remoaners. Snowflakes.I believe the House of Lords does have the power to propose laws in the form of private bills, but the point that I was trying to make is that we're expected to automatically assume that EU laws are inherently bad, and laws made in the UK are good. The lie that continues to be peddled is that the UK is a singular entity, and its interests are diametrically opposed by the EU. There are plenty of British politicians more than willing to enact laws that will leave the poorest a lot worse off, just as there are plenty of EU regulations that protect poor people in this country.You think the Daily Mail or The Sun have mentioned Theresa May's record on immigration since she moved from Remain to Leave? I seriously doubt it. It's fine to say the information is readily available, but it isn't to the 60% of over 65s who voted for Leave. In fact, if you look at access to information and education demographics, a strong argument could be made for saying that there was a direct link between being informed on the EU, and voting Remain. I know they weren't voting for Theresa May, but the willingness of the Leave movement to make a champion out of Mrs May is pretty staggering...I'm confused... So what problems are EU immigrants causing? It can't be that they're claiming unemployment benefits, because we can remove them after three months if they're not working. It can't be that they're stealing all the jobs, because employment has hit record levels in the UK. Driving down wages for low-skilled workers? Don't we have a minimum wage in this country, or should low-skilled workers expect to earn a lot more than that? Is it that immigrants are putting pressure on local services? Because I'd probably point at the MASSIVE Conservative cuts to local government budgets (over 50% since 2010), and failing to address consecutive years of an NHS and education system bursting at the seams before blaming EU immigrants. Not to mention that proportionately, there are more EU citizens working in the NHS than accessing its services... 5% of NHS workers are from the EU (10% of our doctors, 4% of our nurses), and 5% of our population are from the EU. Even if every single one of them were accessing the NHS, it would still break even...Apprenticeships have their place, but they're hardly the solution to the skills problem we have in the UK. Post KS4 education needs a complete overhaul - it just hasn't evolved with the economy. The government has steadily increased the number of available apprenticeships over the last 8 years, and it has had absolutely no effect on prospects for young people. It's just a statistic that the PM can throw out when she's challenged on education during PMQs - it means absolutely nothing.I'm aware that I get a bit carried away when I post about this sort of thing, and its sometimes interpreted as aggression. I just wanted to sign off by saying I really appreciate your comments so far, and I really do respect your opinion.

So, the Australian government would certainly have wanted to put a headline in the media about the topic of immigration, just for the 'headline', nothing else; so they are sending these messages to the media that 'catch' the attention and give them 'headlines'.Look, a UK redditor heard the Australian government officer talking in the radio and said that: ""... they weren't demanding anything close to freedom of movement ...

Leaving Europe could make it far more difficult for UK companies to protect their intellectual property and could see a change in design/product registration laws.Working with your web design team and your web design team collaborating with others could become far more difficult. If you work with an overseas based web design agency, then you may find it more difficult and more expensive to visit them at their overseas office. Web Design agencies could also suffer the same issues as many work with and collaborate with teams across Europe and the globe. Visiting & travel could be made far more difficult & expensive.Intellectual property rights could become more complex as the EU has helped protect designers and their original works over the years. However, a different set of rules could apply and enforcing these copyright laws could become a little more difficult.Could leaving the EU see the cookie law vanish from the UK and UK websites? Many websites dealt with this by adding a pop up informing visitors a cookie was being installed, could this now be revisited and a single page explaining the cookie policy just be required or could we see the (highly unlikely) removal of it from UK websites altogether?Currently if you store data on your website from a visitor who is EU based then their data must be stored on an EU based webhost for data protection.

There definitely were some of those that voted Brexit, but the vast majority were not.Disclaimer:  I did not vote in the referendum, because I did not feel informed enough at the time and so decided to abstain.  I did look into it a lot afterwards and given the chance I would vote leave every time.I also understand how democracy works so we should accept this and mover on.ButThe main reasons for Brexit were this:1.  Immigration.   Though the UK is not in the schengen free movement area, if a person becomes a citizen of any EU country, they can move to the UK very easily.  This was what people were annoyed about, because it meant that the UK's border controls meant nothing.2.  The cost.  The '350 million' was definitely an exageration on the leave campaign's side, but the remainers who claimed we payed nothing was also false.  Taking into account the amount the UK pays, and the amount they get payed back, membership in the EU costs around 200-250 million pounds every week, which is still a rather large amount.3.  Politics.  The top three heads of the EU are all elected without any input from the people.  Not only that but the recent support for EU withdrawal started with the Lisbon Treaty, which was voted against in multiple countries but passed anyway.  Many British people were tired of unelected beurocrats running things from Brussels and wanted control in Britain's capital, London.4.  The lack of a reason to remain.  I have yet to hear a valid reason as to why it is beneficial to remain in the EU.  The costs and sacrifices of being in outway the minor benefits.Its especially sad when strong remain supporters try to ridicule the Brexit vote by calling it 'racist' or 'ignorant'.",dcwclzx,dcvxd17,5q1ry1,0.996861118,0.993722235,Brexit,25-01-17

Wars don't start because people wake up one morning and think to themselves, ""oh, it's ages since we've had a good spot of mass killing"".Wars start because of conflicts of interest between groups who see themselves as distinct. The EU prevents war by fostering shared interests between peoples, and by facilitating the mixing that increasingly makes us see ourselves as one people, rather than many.Brexit's explicit purpose is to dissolve those ties. To foster conflicts of interest between groups that are currently aligned. Farage &amp; co. are pretty clear that they don't just want to see Britain out of the EU. They want the whole EU to splinter back into its formerly separate components. That's a recipe for conflict and ultimately war.",dcxiaqg,dcxegs6,5q1ry1,0.964093808,0.928187616,Brexit,26-01-17

14165,4,tonylaponey,"I don't understand.  Are you saying a decline in sterling has reduced inflation?! It's not the fall in the pound is driving inflation.  You can clearly see it in the price of many goods including fuel and goods such as electronics which have risen.Your assertion that the pound has barely moved since the initial crash is also just wrong. Sterling volatility remains incredibly high post the vote, which has been a great for currency traders as you should know! The Guardian is reporting quite correctly here that cost of living is going up and will continue to do so affecting everyone who spends money. Meanwhile the boost to exports which should arise from the same currency effect is already flagging.  This is a worry because to protect workers from inflation you need to pay them more. But if businesses aren't making more money they can't.  It should be noted that 90% of people voting in the referendum were not prepared to be made poorer by the result even in the short term. That includes the vast majority of leave voters who were promised that they would if anything be richer. There may be trouble ahead! ",dcy1sqh,dcwiik4,5q2ycz,0.00046716,-0.99906568,Against,26-01-17
