9633,3,somewhat_pragmatic,It didn't go so well for us in the USA when housing prices crashed in 2008/2009.  You instantly have owners of property that owe more than their property is worth.  Upside-down mortgages meant that you couldn't afford to sell your house because you would have to make up the shortfall with additional cash you didn't have. This also limited mobility.  Many people couldn't move elsewhere to take a different job because they couldn't get out of their property.  This causes a whole cascade of other problems.We saw homeowners walking away from mortgages surrendering any equity they previously had.  Banks then had way too much foreclosed property on the books and they had difficulty covering investor interest/dividends.  Billions of dollars evaporated in the space of a few years.,d5b71fj,d5affac,4sm8qz,0.908595334,0.817190667,Brexit,14-07-16

9641,3,Vermino,"I'm not an ex-smoker.  But I have my own set addictions as many humans.  My grandma died of lung cancer due to smoking and I saw her lose a longue, to be unable to walk up the stairs, to being in her bed, and dying.  Currently my stepbad hasn't been given much prospect and can't stop smoking.  Allowing vaping should be an option - I agree.  But I see it as a last resort.  One that your doctor prescribes you because you have a life threatening situation.  In other cases your efforts should be in stopping all together.Lord Calannan is also suggesting a publicly funded campaign to raise awareness that vaping isn't as bad as the public thinks at this moment.  (although there still is no scientific consensus)  So I'm guessing he doesn't see it as something restricted, but as a free market product that anyone can / (should) get.  How many years did it take before the public and the tabacco industry were convinced of the damage cigarettes did?  ""Campaigning to prove vaping isn't that bad"" just sounds like you're re-creating a 'cigarettes light' industry battle for the future.",d5bo6vg,d5apk76,4sgfuf,0.252773501,-0.494452998,Against,14-07-16
9642,3,Vermino,"Ugh.  This is so cringeworthy.  At no point does being a parent make your more invested in the future.  Humans are capable for caring for a whole lot.  At no point is it a given that the love for one thing is automaticly less than a parents love.  If the love for children was so magic, then how come people put their own interests first by divorcing?  How come there's child abuse or child services?  How many parents no longer talk to their children because they had a despute, or simply grew away from each other?   And even in the cases where someone is truely a person that's willing to give all for their children and went into politics.  Are you still objective at that point?  You're no longer capable of taking decisions for the common good.  You'll only be making decisions that benefit your specfic children - because your bond, love, and self sacrifice is higher than any other motive you may have.  &amp;nbsp;  I believe modern humans have evolved past our basic instincts, and we're complex beings.  We can do things because we have our own free will, rather than primal urges.  Being a parent is not a factor of how good a politician you are.  It may perhaps be your motive to be a caring politician, but that doesn't mean all other motives for being a caring politician are null and void.",d5borim,4sqm02,4sqm02,0.146876774,-0.706246452,Against,14-07-16

9702,3,Vermino,"Ridiculing points doesn't make them (un)true.  &amp;nbsp;**Body and mind**  He starts by making references to heart &amp; mind.  His point is that EU is too blind to see mistakes.  I still have to meet the first person that says the EU is a perfect organisation.  On the other hand you also don't cut of your arm if you're bleeding after a fall from your bike.  Europe isn't fifa, because you're actually part of the organisation.  &amp;nbsp;  **Evil corperations vote for evil organisations**  The tinfoil hat level about large corperations is absurd.  The reason why global companies want a country to be part of a union with 1 regulation isn't too hard.  Because you'll only have 1 set of regulations.  And let's not forget free movement of people and market ofcourse, which is inherent to EU membership.  By his own tinfoil hat theory, large corperations would benefit from lots of countries with their own regulations - as the regulations are their barriers to keep small competition out.  &amp;nbsp;  **Democracy**  If you're trying to show how awfull democracy is in Europe, only to take the example of a university body.  To then realize it's not even working on such a small scale ... .  Europe is too large for direct democracy.  Even if you were able to elect other MEP's, would you even vote on candidates outside your own country?  I'm betting 95% wouldn't.  You elect a british government, who then sends representitives to Europe.  Who you send to europe is a decision UK makes.  If the UK sends their 'losers' to europe to make legislation, perhaps that says more about the UK than about europe?  At no point does it make Europe undemocratic.  You still elected those people there.  And the british government can remove their representatives if they so desire.  Junker's quote about democracy gets thrown around a lot as well.  But at no point is Junkers opinion the opinion of the EU.  He's still just one voice in a democratic organisation.  &amp;nbsp;  **Trade**  His points about trading are also somewhat bizare.  45% of your trades isn't anything to sneer at.  Even if it is in decline.  A 'personal' trading agreement with good partners like India or Australia are never going to match that.  And that is even assuming you can keep trade agreements with all other countries the same on your own as you could when you were part of the EU, which is highly unlikely.  &amp;nbsp;  **Democracy as an ideal - my viewpoint**  Democracy is a word that gets thrown around so much in these debates, and it has gotten to a point that it has the same value as ""The American Dream"" for americans.  It's become an abstract value that people praise, and desire - but the more they fight for it, the more it's lost.  Personally I feel we europeans (as a continent) mock the Americans with that Dream.  If you look how large the diversity between poor and rich is.  It's an illusion that's taking away their options - as it blocks them from viewing a more social structure in which they would be richer / better off.  The same is happening in the UK.  Just look at the current situation.   Both sides promising, not delivering.  After all the referendum cost you, there is still no progress - no article 50, no plan, no indication that the refendum wasn't binding.  You have a new prime minister that you had no say in whatsoever.  No matter what your personal conviction on the EU, how can you claim that your own government is practicing a democratic process?  They're so quick to point out flaws in democracy, while blatently doing it themselves.  Instead of fighting each other over which side is best over reasons noone can predict, you should be looking at your own government that is clearly not acting in your interest - no matter which viewpoint you have at this point.  How are you allowing this to happen if democracy is such a holy idea?  Let's face it.  The politicians are playing you, and have used the EU situation for their own gain, for their own power plays.

Until it does consumers will suffer reduced choices and increased costs.IF Britain can rebuild it's manufacturing base then there is indeed an opportunity to create jobs in the long run (5-10 years) and rebalance the economy while doing so. However, this won't happen overnight. This also requires continued investment (via reliable funding) and a trained workforce (via education) neither of which the UK has prioritised so far. There is a significant turn around required but it's uncertain if the new leadership in Westminster will support it.Not necessarily. Globalisation of trade has blurred the boundaries of production.Local manufactured goods made from imported parts will become more expensive to make. (E.g. Japanese cars assembled from parts made abroad).  Local agricultural goods that were being farmed by underpaid EU migrants will rise in price once these workers are replaced by UK labourers earning a higher wage. This is assuming these goods remain profitable enough for production to continue here so they aren't moved abroad or even discontinued.Don't forget that UK farmers will lose their CAP subsides, so if the government doesn't replace this funding those who depend on it will be forced out of business. Now, you can argue their dependence on subsidies is evidence of unprofitableness (and you'd be wrong - but that's another discussion about the price stranglehold supermarkets have over farmers) but this doesn't alter the fact that fewer farms means less produce, at least in the short term.Brexit is certainly an opportunity for smaller, local UK businesses to grow their market share, but this will take time.

I am just a simple American who is bad at typing usernames with an irrelevant opinion, but I feel like voicing how I feel on this matter. If you look at this from a purely economic view, this is suicide. As far as the economic issues go, it does not make the slightest amount of sense. Basically, you find more soy-burgers at a conservative barbecue then you do economic reasons for leaving the EU. However, the vast majority of the people that actually make sense on the side of leaving the EU claim no financial reason. To them, it's a matter of freedom. In America, we have two levels of government, state and federal. The states get a good amount of freedom and choice, but ultimately everyone has to answer to the federal government and follow their rules. If one state was originally its own body and joined the union, it would give up its final choice in the vast majority of issues. If one day the federal government started implementing a good amount of rules that the state disagrees with, they might want to leave the United States. It's a matter of freedom and living in a country that parades that matter, I respect the choice of Britian leaving the EU for that reason. They are taking an economic punch to the groin for their freedom. The only downsides I can see to this are as follows:1. A divorced family lives on different sides of the borders. Now if a child has visitation with their parents they need a visa and border security every time they need to go from one house to another2. Some people in a position where they cannot take an economic hit in the slightest and already accepted the loss of freedoms in their life because they can't afford them. Now this person who made sacrifices is screwed because somebody wanted an excess of freedom. 3. It's a Baptist tradition to have three points so I really felt compelled to put this here. I really don't want to bring up religion in a matter of the Brexit but it's not really relevant so please don't, as they say, major in minors. I think we should respect the mass's choice to take the economic hit for their freedom. Oh, but if anyone claims economic reasons for leaving then go ahead and call them an idiot. Anyways, I've never been the biggest fan of fully grown cats, but I do appreciate kittens.Edit: It seems necessary to clear up that I do not think federal matters are the same as EU laws, I just made a comparison between the two.

The economic uncertainty it causes affects the bloc itself, because our economy is leaving, which will weaken the market. It therefore affects all trade negotiations currently underway, weakening the position of the EU. It makes investors consider other locations for their investment. Every country in the EU is losing money for every day that the UK sits on the fence. When A50 is triggered, there will be a big shock to the markets and the currencies again. But that will be the worst, and recovery should set in after that.The longer it goes on, the more damage the EU will take. Not as much damage as the UK, for sure, but they are quite right to be upset that the UK is currently sitting there damaging everything around it and doing nothing to shorten the amount of time the damage goes on for.If anything, they've been quite restrained because they want to be able to do a trade deal with the UK which is as good for both parties as it can be.",d5ferli,4t8l6n,4t8l6n,4.29E-06,-0.999991418,Against,17-07-16

The eu have always been consistent over what we need to do to access the single market.

I guess many people didn't take the time to fact-check the official sides, so could well have been mis-led by the awful propaganda which both sides were spouting.It was clear to me and to most people I know that this would be the only realistic outcome.Um.. no.. the referendum voted to leave the EU. While not *required* to trigger A50, we will have to do so in order to fulfil the pledge made by Cameron and now renewed by May. If we don't trigger it, then the referendum was pointless.I'm not sure what your point is, there, I'm afraid.You said twice ""cuts to the relationship"". I was asking about that, specifically. Cuts to funding, science, etc are obviously going to happen. If a project needs to run for more than 2 years and is dependent on EU funding, then clearly the EU should not start to fund it in the UK. The UK could leave during the project, and the EU funding will stop. The funds will have been wasted. That's common sense. Again, this was one of the things which [many people warned about before the vote](http://scientistsforeu.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/SfEU_factsheet_12-2-2016.pdf).That's not what I mean to say. The *first* big drop in the economy and currency has happened. The *second* one will occur when A50 is triggered. Between those two points in time is a steady decline of investment both to the UK and (to a lesser degree) the EU.**edit** to add that the decline doesn't stop with A50. It will stop when the process is complete, and the UK is out and the terms are understood. Only that will remove all the uncertainty which makes the UK and the EU a risk to investors as things stand.Every day which passes is a day in which major corporations choose to invest in (say) the USA or China because the EU still doesn't have a clearly defined future ahead of it. That will only happen once the UK leaves.In future, yes. Everyone benefits most from a good relationship and nobody wants a bad one. We in the UK have decided not to play with the others any more, but we're refusing to leave the pitch until they give us three goals and allow us to win the match.That's not how it works. If we say we are leaving, we should leave. We can cheer from the sidelines, and even get a little involved if they let us.

These are both disrespectful fallacies and a not at all a high ground position.The ""voted leave, so leave"" argument is in no way based on law. The UK will make it's leave if and when it signs the article 50 and not before. To bitch about that process, is to disrespect right to make our own choice for our country in the legal time allotted. It's just petty and bitchy to complain about it.The cutting of relationships with the UK to make an example or whatever else, is short term thinking and naive. If leaving the EU is such a huge loss to the country, surely the action itself is punishment enough and the EU has no action necessary to claim the high ground. They can sit back, relax and say ""look what happens when you leave"". But they indeed are not doing this. They are actively antagonizing the process, in behaviour that is childish and petty and proves weakness in the EU membership program.The whole thing stinks of sore losing on both sides, with David Cameron stepping down and the EU making cuts.

In an attempt to both please them and to get them to stop complaining, we decided to have a democratic vote whether or not all of our family members should be allowed to eat as much candy as they liked. However, before taking the vote, me and my wife informed our children about the dangers of too much candy. We showed them pictures of rotten teeth and the risks of obesity. Thus, when we took the vote, we were surprised that all three of our children actually voted for unlimited candy!

However, as you might imagine, me and my wife are rather reluctant to allow our kids to spoil themselves like this. Of course we don't *have* to change the rules. We can simply explain to them that this vote was merely meant to confront them with the real world consequences of eating too much candy. But we are afraid that this will make us look like the bad guys and that the complaining will go on for a long time. We are therefore inclined to simply give in to our children's demands.

Yeah, people limiting certain behaviour to one side of a discussion is quite disappointing to see.  &amp;nbsp;  How is it high and mighty to ask someone to do the things they said they'd do?  Article 50 is the legal time alloted to step out in a fashionable way.  It gives the exiting member 2 years to put everything in order.  The only disrespect that's occuring is by the british government because 3 weeks after the referendum they still haven't said which way they'd be going.  Will they dismiss the non-binding referendum, or invoke article 50?  If anything, at least Europe is assuming that democracy will be followed and the article will be invoked.  How is that not respecting?  &amp;nbsp;  As far as I know, no real provocations were made by the EU, except for matters of longer term (2+ years).  If you want to see short term childish behaviour, I would redirect you to Farage's speech in the EU the day after the vote.  &amp;nbsp;  Story time ; One day you join the John Bon Jovi fanclub.

After a week you complain because they're not sending you coupons for the John Bon Jovi concerts and merchandising anymore.  They ask you why you still care, after all you didn't like him anyway?  They then ask what date you'd be leaving.  You however shout that you have every right to be in the fan club as anyone else, and you want the full benefit package!  Leaving the fan club is your personal decision, not something the moderator or other people can force on you.  Question : Who's the dick?

Namely, let's presume Brits have decided to leave the EU for the sake of freedom and indepencence, it's really naive to believe they (the average citizens) will feel any significant change in their freedoms. The global tendency is towards unification and, as the name says for itself, globalization. In one way or the other Britain is linked to the ""financial routes"" of the western world (EU + NA), the multinational corporations that produce goods and provide services are the central pillars of power (via means of financing electoral campaigns and general lobbying logistics), the same goes for the banking sector. All the ""freedoms"" that they didn't enjoy in the EU will remain the same, there will be a feeling of false freedom, as in ""we make our own decisions"" but in truth these will keep coming from the same sources. I'm aware this sounds borderline ""tinfoil hat/conspiracy theories"", it's not meant to. I'm allergic to such theories, this is only the way I think it works and i'm not judging if it's good or bad. The point being, the UK gave up a lot financially to get in return an apparent freedom from the ""evil ties of central alien european governments"". I'm big on idealism and love a good Don Quixote moment, but I think ultimately whether the UK loses or prospers, doesn't depend on whether they are in the EU or not, the  EU just gives you a better chance to prosper (and that comes at a price).",d5kymoi,4t38ar,4t38ar,0.006457457,-0.987085085,Against,21-07-16

The EU obviously wants the best deal for everyone involved, incl. Britain. And has much stronger power for it when united, obviously.

Now is that the case (which is what you would expect from Junker and his crew)or a similar tactic to that of appointing Brexiteers as the UK negotiators, to get the awkward squad on side - in this case, France. There were similar howls when Barnier was appointed Finance Commissioner, assumed to be out to destroy the City of London, but in the end of the 42 EU directives on the subject, the UK supported 40 - and the City still thrives. Britain may have amongst the lowest % of its trade with the rest of the EU than other members, but it is still over 50%. Conversely, the UK only accounts for 6% of total EU trade, so the bargaining chips are stacked against the UK, contrary to the naive beliefs of the Leave camp.  The EU has two conflicting objectives. One is to punish the UK for leaving, to discourage others, the other its trade interests. If it was totally arsy it could say that this was just how to clean up the UK's leaving, it cannot discuss new trade deals until it left. Now countries have no friends, only interests, but would you be a member of a club which kicks a member hard if it dares to leave, against your club's interests? There has been a surge of support for the EU in other members since the mess in the UK has become evident, but this may decline if the EU acts like total bastards - and it is the member states that will call the shots, not the Commission. What is clear is that it is EU politics that will determine this, not what the UK wants. Welcome to reality, Leave supporters. ",d5u98nd,4uu3dz,4uu3dz,0.937823857,0.875647713,Brexit,28-07-16

Hawking is clearly referring to Basic Income and expanding welfare at the expense of the wealthiest in society.Yes, someone is left wiping tables (even though this kind of stuff is already being automated). But Hawking's point is that you can do a menial job that is still needed by society, but then be lifted up to everyone else's level through wealth redistribution.Your comment implies that you fundamentally don't understand his point.He's not even implying that money should get abolished. He's saying that the job market is changing. Unemployment is increasing due to automation and outsourcing of low skilled jobs. So we need a basic income to support low wage workers and the unemployed and limit the vast wealth of the top 1% to avoid a sinister permanent capital owning class forming.Don't even understand the point of this paragraph. Why is it rich?

Secondly, the demographics that overwhelmingly voted leave were the old, the uneducated, the working class.

Europe's people are the safest and best protected in the world.This retard wants to strip away regulations and protectionism to turn us into what? A smaller, poorer USA. Even in spite of the USA's vast wealth (A result of vast resources, population, and WW1/2).Trickle down economics does not work. Free trade actively kills jobs for the working class of a developed nation.Outsourcing and automation are the reasons working class people are struggling to find jobs. Their labour is in less demand and has less value now. All free trade does is encourage outsourcing to places like China and India, where labour is pennies.

However, when British people buy the holiday, it now costs them 10% more.So British people will not be able to afford as many holidays, and when they do go abroad, they will be spending 10% less money.The impact will probably be noticeable in places such as Ibiza and Mallorca, in the resorts where mostly British people go (eg Magaluf).

In the case of Brexit, you can imagine this will continue for quite a while.  How will government handle it all? how will it impact trade agreements?  How good will the new deals be?   ... .  One of those key moments, for me, will be the actual announcement of Article 50.  With a weaker currency, a nation usually exports more.  Because other nations can buy things cheaper there.  Import however will become pricier - as your currency now has less value.  I'm certain things will recover once more stability returns.  Question is how fast that will be, and how much it will recover though.  ",d70ykdw,501vf1,501vf1,0.000210687,-0.999578625,Against,29-08-16

Once the currency and commodity hedging contracts expire, we are in for a pretty torrid time.

So this whole 'let the EU be thrown into chaos attitude' is dumb as fuck.But the original point is, there's no way we can maintain trade with the EU in it's current state, whilst also pleasing the racists by reducing immigration, and whilst also pleasing the 'democracy lovers' by making us not follow EU laws and regulations.Because we have to follow EU laws and regulations if we trade with them so that our products meet their standards.

10541,3,RidingRedHare,"UK imports are about 21.6% of the UK GDP. The EU accounts for 44% of that, and almost all of that is from the Eurozone, where the Pound/Euro exchange rate has stayed within the boundaries of where it was the last five years. So, non-EU imports to the UK are about 12.1% of UK GDP.Now, the most important non EU import countries for the UK are:* USA  * China  * Switzerland  * Japan  * Russia  * Canada  * India  Towards some of the relevant currencies, the pound has not lost as much as towards the dollar. We can expect that if imports stayed exactly the same, the effect of the pound loss of value is about 1% of GDP.But that's not how economies work. When some imports have a price increase by 10%, part of those imports will be replaced by other goods, which will reduce the impact of the price increase on the local market. Similarly, when the value of the pound dropped, some UK companies exporting into non-EU countries were able to increase the revenue (in pounds), for example because those contracts were in US dollars. That again offsets some of the price increase of imports.I cannot find detailed enough numbers to compute anything reliable, but I'd expect that the effect of the lost value of the pound on UK prices due to increased import prices is somewhere around 0.5%. As inflation currently is rather low, and has been rather low for quite some time, those 0.5% should not be a problem.",d73p0ie,4zywjk,4zywjk,5.65E-09,-0.999999989,Against,31-08-16

10553,3,RidingRedHare,"Goods are paid in actual currency, not in percentage drops to previous prices. Â£38.50 after the British Pound drop is $50. Both companies are paying the same for oil, and the have the same absolute cost savings due to the reduced oil price. The UK company then has a small advantage due to the Pound's loss of value, but that advantage is rather small even with a 10% drop of the Pound; especially it is nowhere near 10%. A bit more on that below.If the UK company is selling their goods in the US, the oil component for that barrel will add $110 to the price before the oil price drop and British Pound drop, and will add $50 to the price later. If the US company is selling their goods in the UK, the oil component for that barrel will add Â£64.70 to the price before the oil price and British Pound drop, and add Â£38.50 to the price later. Both are identical assuming that both companies depend on oil to the same extent.There are other differences, though. With the British Pound drop, the UK based company will spend fewer *dollars* on UK labour, thus giving them a small competitive advantage over the US based company, which still pays the same US dollars for US based labour.It is important to know, though, that this advantage is only very small compare to the percentage the Pound lost in value, as UK based labour is only a fraction of total cost, and the cost of imported goods increased, which in turn will cause a small increase in local prices, which in turn will create pressure to increase wages.",d73zgyv,d73uhhk,4zywjk,3.79E-08,-0.999999924,Against,31-08-16

Also, the article makes absolutely no distinction between import and export particulars with which these supposed new trade agreements will be defined. As such, there is nothing that counters any of the comments against you in this thread. I.e. nowhere in this article does it say these new countries actually want to import things from the UK, whilst even David Maddox himself heavily implies that all of these countries will definitely want to export to the UK. Again - nothing in this article refutes the criticisms other posters have made against your viewpoint in this thread. **The Sun**I refuse to even to even click on that link - sorry, but I'm not going anywhere near that shit show of website, that link is staying blue. **Heat Street**My favourite of the articles you've posted, even if it is heavily out of date. One of the interesting things this article puts forward is the potential to join the anti-EU triangle (making it a square I guess) between the UK, Iceland, Greenland and Norway. Very good points and a good opportunity for the UK going forwards and would go some way (my own personal estimate ~25% of the way) to mitigate against losing the EU. - Good stuff!Other than that; we have the exact same issues here as we do with the Express article up top. Lukas Mikelionis doesn't make any distinction between imports and exports and, like Maddox from the Express actually goes someway towards highlighting that this will be a big win for bringing exports into the UK (completely ignoring the elephant in the room; profit-generating UK exports). So again, nothing in this article refutes the criticisms other posters have made against you in this thread. The issue remains that these new countries aren't guaranteed (I dare say aren't even likely) to want to buy UK products at the same level as what the EU currently does. AND - we would have to negotiate new rates for which we would be on the back foot, likely getting worse deals than what we already have with the EU. Again, it's an opinion piece without any quantifiable supporting evidence, you may aswell have linked to a reddit comment. **Daily Fail**Again - outdated article with no recent updatesAgain - not one single reference or link to where any of this information / quotes etc. was actually gathered. I mean,  really? Not even a throwaway sentence saying this was copied and pasted from PMQ's or something? Anyway; the later half of the article is out-dated waffle relating to immediate-post-referendum fallout. The meat and bones essentially comes down a statement from Australia that they would like to trade with us. There is a qoute saying this trade deal could be worth ""Billions"" but Matt Dathan *forgets* to add a reference for as to whom actually made that statement, nor does Dathan link and/or reference to anything that would help back up such a claim. Who actually said this trade deal would be worth Billions to the UK economy? - Dathan's Editor?The most scathing part of this article is in the start of the third, erm, paragraph? Quadrant? Section? (I refuse to call a single sentence with a line-break a paragraph so fuck knows what they are really). Anyway, here Dathan fully admits that any trade agreements with Australia / Canada / US / Other must be made after Britain leaves the EU (not after Article 50 is submitted). So best case scenario here is that the UK is multiple years away from having a trade agreement with Australia, and we would need to leave the EU and be sans any viable trade alternatives  all throughout the interim period. So, potentially good news for the long-term - bad news for the immediate-to-short term. Of course; the article puts forward the Liam Fox is making these agreements anyway, completely ignoring the fact that the UK is banned from making such agreements and none of them would be legally-binding until post-Brexit. But hey - I've tried arguing the legality of making pre-Brexit trade agreements with non EU-countries before, and I do not want to start that argument again (least of all in the midst of a massive thread like this). Suffice it to say; remainers align with the law and see this as illegal, whilst Brexiters align with the whole ""Fuck the EU we'll do what we want"" which, well to be honest, could go either way but no one will know for months-to-years anyway. Again - this article does precisely zero to answer the criticisms other redditors have already laid upon you. It's an outdated fluff piece, with no facts, and it in no way supports your claims. **Order-Order**I was new to this website; I shan't be going back there. I have no idea who actually wrote the article. It's literally a list of countries where allegedly *""government officials or prominent business figures have declared a desire to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain""*. - Rather comforting right?That's it. That's all the article states. No links, no references, no distinction between government officials and prominent business figures. No timelines. Nothing at all useful. It's the epitome of an anonymous fluff piece. The website may as well be called Order-Me-A-Soapbox. **TL:DR**None of those articles support your claims and each and everyone one was a glorified opinion piece. They don't even reconcile with each other which is moronic considering they were all published within just a few days of one another (please see the bottom of this comment for a breakdown). None of these articles have a single damn sentence that in anyway refutes the criticisms other redditors have posed against you. Not one of these articles addresses what the UK would do post-Brexit and prior to establishing a new (completely unknown and vague) trade agreement whilst every one of those articles highlights there will need to be this ""middling time"" which is going to be the crux of what sinks us into yet another recession, and would limit our bargaining power for any subsequent trade negotiations. Now Brexiters will ignore that last statement wholeheartedly with the viewpoint of ""fuck 'em we'll do it anyway"" so it's rather pointless to even debate this component within this forum so it's largely a moot point, unfortunately. **One-less-click**Finally to all the other redditors reading this response, (surprise surprise) not one of those articles if worth your time nor warrants a click - save yourself the hassle and be safe in the assumption it's all whitewashed horseshit fed straight the zealous masses - it's like we learnt fucking nothing over the past few months, then again, I'm not really surprised that's the case.**Numbers in Articles*** Express - 27 Countries* The Sun - Refused to click* Heat St. - 11 Countries * Daily Fail - 12 Countries* Order-Order - 27 Countries (I assume lifted from Express (or maybe from where Express lifted their list) considering South Korea is in the same list-position but has been renamed Korea (Republic of)) - But again, no idea where the *original* list came from.

We're not an enlightened race (human race), we're a barbaric, animalistic, race of creatures with opposable thumbs and clever problem solving skills.Globalisation only really began properly in the 18th century.

Firstly, most of the increase in hate crime post Brexit was against Eastern Europeans.Any analyst with a fucking nut in their head will tell you it's connected. I guess only a brexit voter is so predisposed to deny reason and fact in favour of his 'beliefs' that the Brexit vote wasn't clearly connected to the sharp increase in hate crimes (+400% I think?). Also where's your source that most hate crime is against muslims?Also the refugee crisis where mostly Muslims are fleeing to the EU is a clear and obvious reason why people Muslims and the EU are related.Well it's not at all really is it? Sweden is tolerant, Germany is tolerant. Even France is more tolerant than us. France have 10% Muslim population, UK has like 2%, and only now are the French reaching similar levels of xenophobia to us.Tbh, the demographics say it all. Racism/xenophobia is linked to low IQ and poor upbringing. The demographics that voted to leave were predominantly poor, low educated, and old. There are also connections within those demographics (old people likely received less education, people with low education are generally poor, as a result they have much lower average IQ's etc..)The actual tolerant and compassionate members of society, people with an actual stake in society and have a rudimentary understanding of politics, the educated, the young, the professionals, all voted overwhelmingly to stay.But no, legions of buttfuck Johnny's who work in a warehouses, left school at 16 with an E in history get to drag us all down with them.It's just ironic because the plebs benefited the most from the EU and will get shafted WAY harder than anyone else when we leave.

10615,3,Chris_stopper,This argument get tossed around a lot and I would like to put my 2 pence in.     Fact: There have been brexit voters interviewed (whether cherry picked or not) that have made xenophobic and racist comments.     Fact 2: Since the brexit vote minorities have reported increased harassment and attacks up and down the country.    Fact 3: Brexit vote won by about 1.7 million votes. This is 2.7% of the population.      Question: Is it fair to assume that racists voted Brexit? Not that all Brexit voters are racist. Only given the choice between more and less foreign people around I am going to assume that a racist would chose the latter.         Opinion : I think from growing up around different parts of this country that it is not unreasonable to assume that 3% of the population is racist. be it radically or just subconsciously enough to influence a contested topic like this.              Conclusion: While all Brexiters are not racist I believe it is not unreasonable to argue that the racists could easily be the difference between leaving and staying. At which point I congratulate the Brexit voters for allowing the racists to decide the direction of our country. And if you response to that statement is you don't care because it helped your cause. I say to you. If you don't care about racists then you are a racist. ,d7a4mu4,50khfw,50khfw,0.000202683,-0.999594635,Against,05-09-16

For context, I am mid-40s, so am in the middle of the young EU-passionate generation and the old anti-EU generation. Maybe I understand both worlds a bit, or maybe I'm talking out of my arse. That's for you to decide.That's not *entirely* wrong. They would have had to get a visa and then apply for residency, but they could have kept on being British and had no problems moving about. The devil is in the details. *Any* country welcomes people with a shitload of cash who want to come and live there and spend it. *Buying* freedom of movement is as easy as filling in a form and showing a bank statement.Having freedom of movement as a *right* is somewhat different. That's the key point which those older people are missing. They are also stuck in a timewarp. They think that the UK is still somehow a global superpower, as it pretended to (still) be in the 70s. But I understand this more as I get older. I see the Tories in power, Labour electing a far-left leader, and I think it's 1983 all over again and that Labour are about to hand over control of the country to the Tories for 20 years. I want to scream at the young people: ""READ ABOUT MICHAEL FOOT AND WHERE THIS WILL END - IT IS THE DEATH OF LEFT-WING POLITICS FOR A GENERATION!""While on the other hand, I saw - and I am *not joking* - an editorial in a Mallorcian English newspaper which openly said that some things were ""better under Franco"". Because there was going to be an open parade of homosexuals. It was Gay Pride that week.I guess what it boils down to is this: older people always want to think that the world works just the same as it did when they were young.

As far as I can tell from that website.  If neither are spanish (EU isn't mentioned), you have to have lived there for 2 years.  Living in spain is not going to be an issue for your polish parnet - as he's an EU member.  &amp;nbsp;For yourself, it may be more of a hasstle.  Best case, Brexit won't happen for 2+ years, and there's no issue as you're simply an EU resident.  Negotiations have been postponed for half a year - and many people have said 2 years would be way too short.  Worst case, you'll have to apply for a green card / visum / ... .  My guess?  They'll need those 2 years for making deals on a lot of issues.  Both EU and UK will want to buy some extra time for their citizens living 'on the other side'.  So I would assume they'll implement some form of grace period of a couple of years in which you'll have to sort papers like green cards and other things.  Again, worst case is you'll have to apply for some papers - as you would for any other country, like US.  &amp;nbsp;  So, in 2 years you'll be able to marry there.  Brexit might occur, and you might have to apply for some papers for a short period of time.

10847,3,tweeglitch,"Food Security and other details The UK produces 60% of what it eats which is better than the 30% it was prior to WWII which caused a bit of a problem. For some food stuffs youâ€™re more dependant on imports than others particularly the good stuff for health, fresh fruit and veg. The UK exports whisky, biscuits, fat and meat. Britainâ€™s exit from the EU may deliver a few blows to itâ€™s food security.First blow. Sterling took a hit and a rather sustained one after the referendum. So it doesnâ€™t seem unreasonable to predict another step drop on triggering A50 and again once you actually... finally... leave. The full affect of a currency drop takes time to work through supply chains before hitting consumer prices. As stocks bought when the pound was higher run out, as currency hedge funds deplete, as the first among competing suppliers blinks and raises prices before the rest follow suit. Higher prices for imported goods over months are slowly inching their way from the price of containers at one end of the world to the prices on the supermarket shelves at the other. And that includes the price of food or at least the 40% of it you import. However the homegrown 60% is not immune as costs of imported machinery fertilisers and fuel rise. Inflation won't be the only blow to food security. We have something of a perfect storm brewing here.Second blow. The UKâ€™s food system is migrant labour dependent. There wouldnâ€™t be much UK fresh fruit and veg if it wasnâ€™t for foreign pickers storage and distribution workers. Some crops are more labour dependant than others for example picking soft fruits like strawberries; not an easy thing for a machine to do. The restrictions that will be placed on EU citizens' ability to work in the UK will lead to a labour shortage which in turn puts a further upward pressure on food costs. The slump in currency will make the UK a less attractive place for EU workers to move to for work if they ain't getting a lot of zloty for their pound sterling like what they used to leading to... labour shortage... further upward pressure on food costs. And on top of that people arenâ€™t too keen on having the shit kicked out of them for speaking in their own language making the UK an even less attractive place to migrate to for work, or just to visit, or even look at. The loss of labour alone is enough to force some producers to export themselves and their production so as to stay in the single market as per a lot of other industries (that home produced percentage just dropped a little more).Third blow. EU subsidies make up 55% of UK farming income. Will subsidies stay? Will they fuck. Most pro-Brexit politicians are ideologically opposed to subsidies strongly believing in the â€œfree marketâ€ i.e. no subsidies - if an industry fails, let it. Secondly the UK needs to negotiate new deals not just with the EU but with all the countries and trading blocs the EU had negotiated accords with on behalf of its members over the past four decades. The UK is just a tad smaller than the rest of EU (and consequently so is its bargaining strength), will be rather desperate for trade deals (because it won't have any) and a little out of practice and under resourced when it comes to negotiating such things (because the EU does that for all its members). And farm subsidies might be seen by any negotiating partner as giving your industry a bit of an unfair advantage so there may be some pressure there to drop them. And besides you wonâ€™t be able to afford it with your economy going down the shitter when everyone from car manufacturers to finance companies are leaving so as to remain in the single market. So the 60% of home grown food the UK produces may take another bit of a hit when the lose of subsidies makes a lot of farms no longer a viable economic option.Fourth blow. The imposition of new tariffs but also the disruption to supply chains caused by non-tariff barriers such as WTO quotas and goods inspections to check for regulatory compliance and security reasons. To be able to charge the right amount of duty there now needs to be the systems and processes and infrastructure and people in place to value and determine the origin of goods. Not a small task given stuff tends to be made of parts from a variety of places. Granted these things are already being done but aren't and haven't been done for trade between the UK and other EU countries for some decades. And given the volume of that trade this amounts to a big change. Particularly so for UK exporters who for the ease and simplicity only exported within the single market. Supply chains snake back and forth across national boundaries over the EU in many industries and food is no exception. Millions of food contracts depend on cross continental supply chains. Itâ€™s why roads are clogged with food wagons. The food system is heavily tied into Europe. When the UK lorry strike occurred in September 2000, it emerged that due to the highly efficient just-in-time logistics hard-wired into the UK food system, supplies were an estimated 3-5 days at any one time. Extra checks and administrative hurdles between the UK and EU will disrupt or even destroy many supply systems particularly so for time critical consignments like fresh fruit and veg. How will for example cabotage arrangements survive post UK exit? I just wanted to throw that word in there because I like it, cabotage. It sounds like a portmanteau of cabbage and sabotage so kind of apt.Fifth and final blow, the knockout punch. The first four have been discussed extensively in the media though i haven't seen many places where they've all been tied together and discussed in the context of food security. This fifth issue I haven't seen discussed much at all and there's a reason for that. It's detail. Those in the media doing all the talk on the UK's exit don't do detail: journalists, ideologues, business leaders, economists. These people tend to be more focused on the bigger picture. The situation is a lot worse than any of these 'experts' are able to predict because for some problems if you only see the bigger picture then you aren't seeing much of the problem at all. In this case the devil isn't so much in the detail but a screaming horde of demons are waiting on the gates of article 50 to open.The problem is in untangling from existing dependencies, updating existing systems and processes and recreating systems and facilities you previously shared with the rest of the EU so you now have to have your own little UK equivalent. For the public and private sector the biggest problem isn't the new more cumbersome slower expensive etc routes to trade as per that fourth blow. The biggest problem will be the transition to that new and more shittier state. And in attempting that transition some of the biggest challenges will be in updating legacy IT systems. Yeh yeh yeh just like Y2K turned out to be a non-problem. No. Y2K would have been problem if the work hadn't been done. The work got done. It was a very widespread issue but you could have trained monkeys to make most of those code changes. It was basically the same simple fixes made over and over in loads of different places, ok sometimes finding the problems e.g. embedded systems was hard but there were no changes to business rules just fixes to code. A programmer or analyst wouldn't have needed to ask a domain expert (accountant banker tax consultant or whoever the system is for) if some date in a calculation is supposed to wrap round to 1900. It was mostly all at the code level and similarly though to a lesser extent the euro introduction. With Brexit though the rules are changing and no one knows to what, all we know so far is that Brexit means Brexit.Rather than comparing this situation to Y2K it might be more appropriate to compare it with the public sector's wonderful record for completing IT projects within budget and deadlines or even finishing at all. E-Borders, half a billion spent over several years before abandonment. The BBCâ€™s digital media thingy a billion spent over several years before that too was abandoned. NHS Connecting for Health mostly abandoned but some parts continued, ten years, 12 billion spent 10 billion over budget. And then the Universal Credit System (Idiot Dumbdumb Smith's baby) a whopping 12.8 billion since 2013 with 2.2 originally planned. And likewise the private sector, mergers with banks such as RBS havenâ€™t gone ahead simply and purely because of the difficulty in integrating systems. In most of these cases the deadlines were somewhat arbitrary as in if we donâ€™t make it in time we can carry on plugging away until we finish or run out of money. But in the case of Brexit you have two years unless perhaps all 27 other members agree an extension (unlikely lol). No wait did I say you have two years? (I did). Maybe the situation is a little worse, maybe the deadline will be a little tighter because nothing can be done to prepare for the new regime until its known what it will mean beyond â€˜Brexit means Brexitâ€™. It wonâ€™t be until any agreements are fully negotiated and signed that there can be any clarity about what the new rules are and so what changes need to be made to adapt to them. How long will be given for this transition when some in the Tory party don't even want to use the two year article 50 limit! And in these examples there were existing systems that can continue to be used while replacements are in development and act as fall back systems should projects go tits up. Not so in this case unless perhaps you accept the Euro, join Schengen and pay full dues. No one is asking what the systems implications, dependencies, costs and timescales of re-introducing hard customs borders with the EU are. Some systems are more vital to the running of the UK than others and some are impacted by the change more than others. One particular system which is somewhat vital to the smooth running of the UK will be more affected than any other. Customs Handling of Import and Export Freight or CHIEF. HMRCâ€™s CHIEF system manages the declaration and movement of goods into and out of the UK calculating revenue thereon. It is also (for the time being at least) a means by which UK traders communicate with counterpart customs systems in other EU states. It also (again for the time being at least lol) connects with the EUâ€™s ECS (Export Control System) which allows the sharing of security and safety data regarding the movement of goods among member states. It is also integrated with the goods scheduling systems at ports such as Dover, Felixstowe and Harwich and also airports. Iâ€™m told Dover has an average goods in waiting time of 40 minutesâ€¦ for the time being at least LOL! And speaking of security i.e. ECS if the UK is no longer a participant how might that impact waiting times at docks and airports? Customs checks tend to be  intelligence-led, high-risk consignments, high-risk origins and high-risk consignors are targeted for guns, drugs, counterfeit, people, nukes and cigarettes. If the UK is no longer a part of ECS and Europol or has a lesser participatory role then well... if you cut yourself off from the information flow, you know less about individual consignments and less about the consignors. As a result, you are less able to make informed (intelligence-led) decisions as to risks. The absence of data thus requires a greater degree of physical intervention - i.e. inspection. And so more cause for delay. Delay meaning grinding to a complete halt. Anyways, back to CHIEF.CHIEF was not written yesterday by teenagers in javascript using node js. You canâ€™t download the source from Github. You can't run it on your phone. You look at it via special green screen terminals. Itâ€™s is written in dun-dun duuuunâ€¦ COBOL! Itâ€™s communication protocol is EDIFACT. Itâ€™s DBMS is IDMS(X) and OS is VME both from ICL. ICL went out of business 15 years ago! This is 70s technology! For several years HMRC had been throwing cash (around a billion maybe) at CapGemini or Accenture I canâ€™t remember which for a ground up re-write (anyone who knows anything about large legacy IT systems should shudder at the phrase). It came to nothing though.One of the reasons (the main reason) most will attempt a rewrite is to make it easier to introduce changes. As more mods to the system are made over the yearsâ€¦ decadesâ€¦ the system becomes more complicated and harder to change. This is because changes are introduced in such a way to minimise the immediate risk of introducing more problems at the expense of making the system more complicated and so long term becoming riskier to make changes to. This is an issue for important systems vital for running the most basic functions of a country and economy within banks and government. The simple reason being they were the first to introduce computer systems. Increasingly it's code that runs businesses and countries but nobody is quite sure what a lot of it does any more. However the fact HMRC were desperate enough to rewrite and the fact it failed in spite of the piles of money thrown at the problem should give some indication of how sclerotic this system is, how difficult time consuming and risky it is to make changes to, and that risk of unintended side effects increases exponentially with the number of simultaneous changes. Oh look what's coming over the hill? A whole stampeding herd of change requests that are gonna need doing before the UK exits. And not just changes there's a whole stampeding herd of new data to put through the system and users who've been accustomed to the ease and simplicity of exporting within the single market will be clicking all the wrong buttons and clogging up tech suport. And it's not like COBOL programmers grow on trees in fact in a lot of cases they are 6 foot under and have trees growing through them. There'll be quite a bit of competition for those that are still alive given there'll be a whole host of other large legacy systems in various other sectors that'll need modifying like for example banking and finance who will probably be able to pay a little more for the work. So can this major system, part of the backbone of the UK's infrastructure be updated in the time available which will be what? Given how successful large IT projects have NOT been at meeting deadlines within budget or even finishing at all what kind of deadline are we looking at for introducing the necessary changes to the UK's customs systems? So the article 50 process has completed and the negotiators on that matter have done their job in putting together an agreement which the politicos have signed. And so now the old trading rules no longer apply. ""So how long have we got to implement these changes?"" ask the developers. The politician replies ""well I've just signed the deal so... zero seconds."" ""And where are the specs?"" ask the developers. ""Erm... Brexit means Brexit?"" But the situation is worse than that, the deadline will be a little tighter than zero seconds because negotiations on new the trading arrangements even if they take place in parallel with the article 50 talks (which may not be the case) are likely to take a lot longer than the two years article 50 is allowed. In which case you might think that WTO rules will apply but the problem here is that the WTO quotas and tariffs were negotiated by the EU for the UK and its other members as part of the EU and so both the UK and EU will have to negotiate between themselves and the WTO on their new schedules. So the developers turn to the politicos and ask for specs for the changes needed to adapt customs systems to the new rules and they reply ""well er we're still discussing this and these discussions are likely to continue for a few more years."" Only Dr Who could meet such a deadline!Can we basically say trucks backed up from docks wrapping round the M25 two times over? How long will this deadlock last? Weeks months years?

10884,3,jackcadesghost,"Dumb Brexiteers don't know EU from elbow!(BBC state)  I'm sick of the narrative suggesting all Brexit voters are dumb bigots with no idea of what they have voted for. Firstly the vote is over: get over it!  Let me explain for all those at the BBC and all those momentum and Corbyn kids . I worked in agriculture and horticulture and never saw fruit rotting on trees or cattle starving in the fields. Fruit picking was great for single mothers, students (including foreign ones) and many unemployed who could get work for 8 months of the year.   Because the work was there a farmer could rarely get away with low wages or bad conditions. All was well in rural kent, then it happened... It was slow at first. The 90's went on and farmers began turning the mothers away. I then joined the forces but kept in touch with my horticultural hombres. I heard tales of farms which had employed the working class of my village for generations who were now only taking foreign labour. Cheap caravans were purchased so the workers could live on site, (and pay rent of course). Eastern European gang leaders were employed. A few English people worked as supervisors and drivers, (these were my eyes and ears). Conditions were bad but because of the wage disparity across the EU it was well worth the discomfort: well they kept coming back.  I came out the forces and many of these farms now had processing plants built on site. They had grown exponentially and I admit this growth would be good for the economy. The workers however save a large amount of their money to take home where it can buy more. I would speak to them at the local store where they would buy the cheapest food and alcohol. They could not believe the prices. Rarely would they got to the pubs for the same reason so maybe the effect on the local economy was not so great. No longer did the isolated pubs get grubby groups of students, mothers and working class Brits come in for a post work pint or two.   Since then it has got worse. Those pubs are gone and the farms and pack-houses almost solely employ foreign labour.  So who benefits from this? The landowners -yep- , the factory owners -yep-, those who want a cheap cleaner -yep-, those who want a cheap au-pair for Rupert and Amelia  -for absolutely bloody certain: YES!   So what harm has this caused? Well many Brits now have no work, students don't get the value of mixing with the prole and learning the value of manual labour. Single mother's need to rely more -often solely- on benefits. When I worked on farms they would take their kids to school, all jump in a car  and work flat out through breaks to finish with a 1/2 pint 20 minutes before school kicked out. Now the farmers have the workers stuck on site paying rent, working in poor conditions and with longer hours.   This has caused resentment and has caused stagnant wages in all manual work. Go ask a builder, (not one who owns the company).    Around 50% or Tory MPs are private landlords. I live in a room that costs Â£80pw. I now garden for Â£5 per hour on the 'black market'. If I tried the minimum wage I would simply be gazumped  by all the other gardeners who have arrived on the shores. They often share houses so live cramped but cheaper than myself. I know many claim benefits as well because I sign on in the winter. I watch them sign then walk by their van where they are working. This is a small anecdotal sample but ask about.  They are good people and hard working just like us Brits but the BBC and Labour party has sent us down the river. They are the culprits. The Tories can't be blamed because this WAS their model also. At least they admitted it unlike Blair who did it behind our backs. Now Corbyn is not true labour, he is supported by those same students who years ago would have understood the issue because some would have worked on those farms and fields. Now they are ideologues who claim to love the working class until they produce a contrary viewpoint then we are uneducated racists. I am uneducated in their eyes, I am not racist. The BBC and left wing media struggle with this, on one hand they lionise the working class on the other they patronise us when we voice the effects of their multicultural experiment.   This is why labour can't win an election, this is why Brexit won the vote, this is why the working class is often disconnected from politics. This is why we need a real discussion before the working class find the only relevant party to be Tory or the far right. In much the way Trump is a condition of the politics of the democrat, UKIP and Brexit is a condition of the left ignoring the working man and woman. They still don't get it and this arrogant stupidity is actually getting laughable when the Labour party are still fighting for open borders and the parliamentary labour party who supported Owen (whoever he was) supported a second referendum! I'm a progressive not a Tory but I will vote Tory or UKIP if they keep on this path. I know they don't care for my vote but I am one of many, the same many who voted in June of 2016.

10922,3,Vermino,"Do you guys understand basic economics?  This article is about a guy who's happy that the pound is weak.  As he's now able to import UK products cheaper.  In general a weak currency improves export - as a foreign nation can now get items cheaper from your country.  A year ago he had to pay 1,6 dollars for every pound.  This is now down to 1,3 dollar.  Meaning a product that's priced at 100 pounds, became 30 dollar cheaper - simply thanks to the exchange rate.  &amp;nbsp;  Obviously, you're thinking, awesome, we're magic - we're selling more things!  Which is true, but it doesn't stop there.  Britain is mainly a nation of IMPORT.  Meaning it gets more from other countries, than it exports to other countries.  Now, all these items have become more expensive for british to get.  Because 1 pound no longer buys the same products.  It's a weaker currency.  So now you pay 1,2 pounds for the same product.  Obviously this increased cost is put into the price of the product over time.  So the product that used to cost 100 pounds, now costs 110 pounds.  Simply due to exchange rates.  This is obviously painfull for citizens in the UK, as you're now able to buy less goods with the same wage.  Export usually remains at a higher rates, as the goods remain relatively cheap for foreign countries.  (the increase in price is less than the benefit from the exchange rate)  &amp;nbsp;  While the immediate plummet after the vote did not occur, it's clear that the pound has taken a downward spiral for quite some time now. And Brexit hasn't even officially started.  &amp;nbsp;  After Brexit you'll also have possible tarrifs to worry about on both import &amp; export.  This will also mean that import becomes even more expensive, enhancing this effect even further.  &amp;nbsp;  Obviously, someone who's BUYING from the UK is going to be thrilled.  Everything just became cheaper.  That however is not something positive for the british people.  Because that also means your buying power diminishes.  Both on your own market, as on foreign markets.  &amp;nbsp;  But I don't feel it yet?!  Prices take some time to adjust.  Producers want to remain as competitve as they can, and they'll simply hope the exchange rate improves over time.  However, when that doesn't occur for a longer period of time (3 months and counting atm), they'll adjust their prices.  ",d883gez,d86ptct,54vopn,7.19E-07,-0.999998562,Against,30-09-16

I think the issue is we're on the cusp - changing from the tolerant and inclusive to the hateful and prejudiced. While we're in the switchover period I guess it's tempting to use 'extremism' as the behaviour under discussion has been extremist up to now.

A significative role will be played by expectations though, we still don't know if people will be optimistic or pessimistic (on both british and foreigner side), apparently there are no good signals, the announcement of new immigration policies and the instability of the GBP are not good. People are irrational so it's too soon to say it, recession may be the outcome of this situation, inequality could increase a lot.All those who say economy will soon get better actually don't have the slightest idea of what economy is, brief term never sorts things out, so however it goes UK's economy won't improve for years. The outcome of all this matter will be clearer as the agreement procedures develop next year.Investors are unsure and uncertainty causes instability in change rates. Also consider that the recent drops of GBP's value were merely due to brexit announcement, we can assume it will drop further in the next few years, when brexit will actually leave the EU.In a political perspective I guess people won't perceive the change, since British people were not even aware they were voting members of the EU parliament, anyway the possibility of internal political crisis will certainly increase.The government will receive a lot of pressure and will have to adeguate to EU standards anyway to commerce with the EU, they will have to do it with their own laws though, increasing significantly administrative costs.Well, anyway people can't expect the situation to go back to when the EU didn't exist, because it does exist (independently by the fact you are in or out) and because times have deeply changed.Sorry for the ambiguous answer but, really, there is no way to answer with certainty right now",d8sztrg,57cw8p,57cw8p,8.96E-09,-0.999999982,Against,15-10-16

If the UK decides to disregard the result of the referendum they will lose a lot of credibility as they are contradicting their own people, so I think this is the least likely route, as they will not be able to save face.The most important component of the UK economy is the financial services sector. For financial services to thrive maximum exposure to the EU single market is required. If the UK leaves the EU there will be a continued drop in the value of the pound, and a growing number of financial services companies relocating to continental Europe or elsewhere.The UK will eventually re-enter the European Union as the next generation comes of age, but the meantime will be painful for them.

How about we make the goal a better quality of life for citizens ? Maybe we shouldn't work ourselves to an early grave just to make 'the economy' grow a little more, maybe we should slow down, work less and take an economic hit.

11468,3,TwosipsTony,"Our opinion isn't the popular choice The4ker. Here's why, when a lot of people think of leave voters they assume we are mostly uneducated bad people who have no respect for others. We represent all that the left wing detest. They only see this from the side of we want to be a bad team player and leave everyone behind regardless of, what they would call, the consequences. Now I'm not talking about people like Tusk or Junker as I believe they are elected in a fair way, even though the people don't directly elect them, so all this talk of un-elected officials confuses me. When I mean they have no respect for democracy, I mean when they put a vote to Greece on a bailout with austerity measures due to their failing economy, the Greek people voted no, they put the austerity measures on them regardless. Now If anything, look at how the EU are treating the UK who decided to leave, they if anything, are bitter. They have taken a very hard stance in order to punish the UK to deter any others from leaving. To anyone who thinks they should, in my mind, are the people who should really be receiving the treatment of leave voters. You shouldn't have to put a ball and chain on countries to make others stay. What kind of argument is that in defending the EU. I care a great deal for people, forget your skin, origin, who you love, and this is not the response that reflects this.Another reason people dislike the leave voter stance is protectionism, as in the feeling people are being so patriotic they are willing to leave the rest of he EU behind. If you want to see protectionism, look at the EU as a whole, the EU has left the rest of the world behind. For example, they put Trade barriers in the way of non EU nations and businesses in order to limit external competition. And trust me when it comes to trade, competition is a good thing. People want to be the best of the best so when they have a good competitor, they innovate quicker in order to keep up. This is just one example of protectionism on an EU scale. I for one didn't vote in terms of 'Britain for Britain', I voted because I wanted to trade with the other 8 tenths of the world, and with the EU hopefully for the benefit of the EU and definitely for the benefit of the UK. Of course if the EU aren't interested we will go back to WTO regulations like the Americans, Canadians, India, Japan, China have to when trading with the single market. Averaging 4% Tariffs on good and services, the pound has already dropped around 18% so that's no big deal. I of course don't want this as it makes no sense to do this. Keep trade free, it makes sense for both sides and is simple the logical thing to do.Basically these points will never be up voted, never be accepted because the majority of the internet only see the red paint on the dying rose. They see, the togetherness of Europe, how loving we are as one, how it benefits us economically and socially. The EU has been nothing but good. It has done well, but now it's loosing its way.

Brexit gave many country's, inculding my country (The Netherlands) the idea of also leaving. But many people don't realise that being in the EU is better than going out of it. The free movements of people, goods. Single currency (what you don't have). The fact that the resources of the EU are able to be one of the most strongest economies on the planet. So, what will the EU do to show the still remaining country's? It will show that it will only get worse if you leave. You are being told that there are trade deals waiting to be taken. But the trade partner you need the most is the EU. And thinking that dealing under the same principles as before is possible, forget it. Personally: i think the UK deserve it. People voted without being properly informed. And the undesirable movement in the UK to say fuck you to everything that is goverment related. At the end of the day people are dealing with people.

To put it in terms you that are meaningful to you, the US will now decide on the shape of your bananas. And this will be enforced by an American dominated court. And you will have to pay for the privilege. Oh how the tables have turned.One of the main economic arguments for Brexit was  the supposed ""incompatibility"" of the UK with other EU states; well NAFTA by orders of magnitude more incompatible. Nobody in NAFTA really wants to buy anything from the UK either; UKs biggest export is cars, good luck selling Minis in North America. The UK will loose even more of its industrial base to low income Mexico, it will loose Agriculture to Canada, and technology to the US. What can the UK hope to get in return?

11749,3,British_guy83,"I will try my best to explain my point of view on the Brexit vote and discuss a little on what you just said. My view is not the only point of view and I'm sure others will have their own view. (I am an Ex-pat and I didn't vote because I didn't like having just two narrow choices)1) for the vast majority of Brits I think the vote was more of an 'anti-politician' (anti-david cameron in particular) and 'anti-London focused policies' movement as much as it was 'anti-EU governance'.British people who didn't feel respected or heard, by the people who made the decisions, were the most likely to vote against the EU. The working class mostly.The working classes are the most affected by immigration and as you pointed out about 80% of those low paid jobs are being taken by immigrants from elsewhere.Most working class kids start their working life in a low paid job and British people have a genuine concern that maybe their children will struggle to find jobs because of a lax immigration policy. There is also a question there of 'why is it that the government won't invest and help British people instead of bringing in other people?' And mostly they feel that our politicians prefer immigrants to come and do the jobs cheaper than the natives because our politicians are rich and don't care about the poor..... Managers also prefer to hire foreign workers because they keep silent about any problems in the workplace and many of them aren't sure on what their rights are asIworkers in Britain. It's an abusive situation for the person concerned and its a situation that further undermines native British workers.2) the vote was mostly about policy:- If I said that 'I think there are problems in the farming sector.....farmers are buying too many cows'...this doesn't mean I am against farmers or against cows...(Or as someone else said..a implying b doesn't mean b implies a).Part of the problem of what you are seeing at the moment is that for many years, our government wouldn't talk or listen to any concerns about immigration by saying/implying that it was racist to talk about it. They gave a platform to UKIP who were the only (non-totally-racist) party who were talking about immigration in a way that wasnt neo-nazi. It's a failure on the part of our mainstream politicians that they ignored people and shut down the debate until UKIP became a legitimate threat. It didn't help that they couldn't give numbers on immigrants arriving or even give an estimate of how many illegal immigrants had possibly entered the country once they decided to talk about the issue. (If illegal immigration doesn't worry you then you can tell polish MP's to calm down with their 'human garbage migrants'  panic!)The lack of debate and the willfull ignorance shown on the subject by our own politicians created a hostile feeling in the UK about the issue of Immigration. The same as you see in Poland with the migration crisis.3) integration concerns:- I personally know polish people that have lived in the UK for more than 15 years and they still struggle to speak basic English. Part of that reason is because a lot of their social interactions are orientated around the polish community and they rarely feel the need to speak or interact with the English. If you look around pretty much any immigrant areas you will see polish shops have popped up everywhere. In a way, This further alienates the polish community in my opinion, because it is a very visible way of showing a lack of integration. (Personally, I love them!!) There have also been many British people that i know who complain about Racist comments from people in the polish community towards black British and Asian British people. (I too have heard many comments and jokes, You may not have heard them or propogate them, but many young single polish lads do!)This lack of willingness to integrate into the British culture and accept our values creates resentment in some people. It's not something unique to Britain. In the Dordogne region in France the locals complain to me about British people that have lived for 15 years in France and still don't speak basic French.....Spanish in Spain have problems with British who don't speak Spanish!!....how many polish people do you know who have commented about how British people don't know how to speak other languages???......I understand their frustration!!....when in Rome....3) housing and Local services:- many polish and eastern europeans who come to the UK to work will happily house share to try and make life in the UK cheaper so that they can save their money for when they return home so that they can buy a house or invest in a company or job in their country of origin. It's a great and noble goal and I greatly admire it!.....but you have to be aware that this has consequences for native Brits.....two eastern european couples moving into a two bedroom apartment can easily pay a higher rent at a lower personal cost per person than a British couple with kids moving into a two bedroomed apartment.Landlords prefer to have foreign eastern European workers in their apartments/houses because they can charge higher rent with a lower chance of default. They can make more profit so they increase rent prices. A two bedroom apartment for a British family will now be at the price it is for 4 single eastern Europeans. Landlords can also capitalise on a foreigners ignorance of UK housing law. Foreigners are much less likely to complain about sub-standard housing. For the foreign worker; it's a temporary accommodation for a few years until they earn what they need. They might even know that the house isn't to standard but don't care because it's temporary. once those workers move on though, they leave behind a house that is in terrible condition because of the landlords lack of investment. (This is not an immigrants fault....this is the landlord!...but some people will wrongly blame the immigrants for creating the situation when their actual issue is immigration and housing policy) the landlords should invest in the house but it would be easier just to move in more immigrants who will accept the accommodation.Schools, hospital services....etc....are put under pressure by unplanned immigration. The key word is 'unplanned.'.... Money has to be diverted from the edcation of British children to be given towards helping integrate foreign children so that they understand what is being taught....that money could've been used to further help British kids and that causes resentment.... Here in mainland Europe I work as a volunteer English teacher with an English-speaking Polish woman who has polish national kids. Here, she has to pay to teach her kids French privately. Her kids, her decision to move here, her responsibility to ensure that the kids understand the language. I might guess that it would be the same in Poland???....or would someone who moves from say...pakistan to poland find themselves getting help with an interpreter teaching their pakistani kids enough polish to integrate?? I doubt there are many polish who speak Urdu?4) Indifference to Europe:- I'd argue that most Brits feel indifferent to Europe. We don't care for it one way or the other. While we may like it...we don't feel a part of it. While we may hate it...we also fear it. Maybe this is due to our history and national mentality as an Island. We have always, for much of our history, been separate from the rest of Europe whilst being a part of the 'European continent'. I don't think we are strongly 'for Europe' the same as we aren't strongly 'against Europe'. Same goes for other Europeans....not 'for' or 'against' them.....but there is an element in every society that feels very strongly on a subject and there is a minority on both sides of the immigration debate which either passionately love or hate immigrants. You find that everywhere!! And for every subject!! It's human nature.5) national identity:- I would argue that for a long time and espescially highlighted since the Scottish Independence referendum; the English espescially have been suffering an identity crisis. (Wales too to an extent!). In England our national identity has been mixed up with football style hooliganism and BNP styled racism. A lot of us shun and condemn that kind of behaviour...so we move away from it and don't feel a part of that identity.... But we have nothing to replace it with... 'British' is all encompassing and is a broad brush like saying 'European'...i could say we are all European but we arent all the same identity in Europe.... Our old ideas of 'English Gentleman' seem too stuffy and has a sense of class system that we no longer feel a part of....Ireland and Scotland still have a sense of 'fluffy/cheeky' national identity that isn't tied up in a racism sense (Although there is an Anti-English sentiment sometimes) and England has yet to reclaim our sense of 'nice' national pride and sense of community.... with the exception of a few national celebrations and sporting events....because of this lack of identity of who 'we' are.....we are starting to define ourselves by who 'they' are (EU, Immigrants, big corporations, politicians....etc...) And we are reaction accordingly.Anyways....this is mostly a few ideas and thoughts I've been having on the subject....would really welcome any criticisms or expansions on those ideas!TL:DR - the Brexit vote was actually mostly an internal immigration policy issue and not the fault of immigrants. The mismanagement of immigration by our politicians has created a resentment among people. Most people don't blame immigrants, a few idiots do but shouldn't!!...",d9gn7uf,5agdhn,5agdhn,0.965292556,0.930585111,Brexit,01-11-16

What is important to note though is that there is nothing wrong, unethical, or immoral about patriotism. Having national pride is one thing, being racist and/or xenophobic is completely different.The sad thing is that people think that national pride implies racist and/or xenophobic beliefs, and so it is becoming frowned upon. How mad is that? I would be frowned upon for saying ""I love Great Britain"", or for decorating something with a union flag.It's okay for France to project their flag onto a building.It's okay for children in America to sing a patriotic song.But it's racist to be proud of being British or wanting independence in Britain.The whole Brexit environment brought out the worst in both camps. You had rich people denouncing poor people, you had native* people denouncing foreign people, you had poor people denouncing rich people, and you had foreign people denouncing native* people.As I said, sadly, some of those people are racist and/or xenophobic.The same happened in WW2. When the opportunity presented itself, people with sadistic tendencies on all sides committed acts of horror and depravity. The Americans, the Japanese, the Germans, the British, the Russians.Why? because there is always a distribution of people without morals, and when the opportunity presents itself, they take it.This doesn't mean that all people are evil, or that all people are responsible for the acts committed by the few.Luckily, as a nation, we're actually still mostly decent folks.

Xenophiles are generally not odious individuals who spit on Polish immigrants or punch 18 yo female Syrian refugees selling the Big Issue,  incidents which have happened in the local town centre since the referendum. I do not think all MPs are war-mongers, or that all soldiers are war-criminals because of the actions of some of their peers.

11779,3,gracewalter,"Brexit aftermath It has been reported last month that David Harewood, an acclaimed British actor, best known for his portrayal of Daivd Estes, a CIAâ€™s director in Homeland, and lately seen as Olivia Colmanâ€™s side-kick in The Night Manager, has been recently asked â€œwhen are you going home?â€ by strangers in the street. As shocking as it may seem to literally every thinking person on this planet â€“ that kind of behaviour, driven by the result of Brexit vote, has drastically increased in its aftermath. According to Police statistics, there were 10,044 incidents of racist and xenophobic abuse over the two months following the big decision. One of the first stories to emerge was that of a Polish mum in Cambridgeshire, who found an anonymous message in her car window while picking up her children from school.The card read: â€œleave the EU. No more Polish vermin.â€I remember that whole week ahead of the vote. Definitely not a good one for me: I was insanely busy with work, relocating and my masterâ€™s research. Brexit was the last thing on my mind that Thursday morning, but my phone lit with push notifications from friends and followers. I switched the TV on and got confirmation of what millions of EU immigrants have feared for weeks. My heart dropped as I watched how the narrow-minded propaganda with the faces of Nigel and Boris triumphed. I remember sitting in my tiny living room and listening to what Mr Farage was saying with a mixture of disbelief and slowly growing anger. Soon after we heard from the Prime Minister, who resigned, Boris came forward claiming he will not be taking part in the run for the next leader vacancy. Then Nigel stepped down as the leader of UKIP, and it was like watching rats abandon a burning ship.That was only the beginning. Soon reports of hate crimes spreading across the country began to flood the news. An Italian knocked out with a bottle for asking how someone voted; a man in Hackney screaming at a taxi driver â€œf*cking foreigner, go back to your countryâ€; the building of Polish Social and Cultural Association in west London marked with racist graffiti; Eastern European men beaten and badly injured for speaking their native language in a park; and then, Arkadiusz Jozwik, a Polish immigrant, killed by a group of teenagers in Harlow, Essex.Maybe I should have started with a few words about myself, just to help you understand where is this letter coming from. Firstly, my name is - obviously - not Grace Walter. I got that one off John Mayerâ€™s Walt Graceâ€™s Submarine Test. My real name is more unusual, rather original, and very much foreign. I guess, in the language of said Nigel Farage, I am a bloody immigrant. However, as always with us expats â€“ there is so much more to the story. Apart from being a part-time waitress, I am a full-time student, currently in my last year of postgraduate course in Arts, at one of the biggest British universities. At the same time, I volunteer with a local charity, and try to gain industry experience while working on various festivals across the country, and lately in London. In other words, I am trying to make do with what I am given â€“ and the mysterious key word here is opportunity. Something so painfully missing from my pre-London life.I was raised believing good things will happen if you work hard. Maybe itâ€™s because my parents belong to the last generation to grow up under the communist regime. They know what itâ€™s like to have your head full of dreams, and your wings cut even before youâ€™re born. This feeling of being trapped inside a cage was something I reckon they worked so hard to spare me. So they send me to a ballet school, because I begged them to do so for a long time. Then they bought that old second-hand piano and drove me to lessons every day after school. And I loved it, and loved them even more for that. In return, I was grateful, patient, hard-working â€“ a straight A student. I wanted to give back to them for all their sacrifice and help, and for making me believe I am strong enough to become whoever I want. They saw the world around changing, new exciting opportunities arising, and as always â€“ wanted the best for their children.So when they heard my idea, which I screamed at them one July evening, after a year of hopeless and desperate jobseeking, they went silent for a long while, and then agreed to do whatever they possibly can to help me move to a different country, on the other end of Europe. This is how I first got to the UK, in the Summer of 2014. After fighting for months to get any employment back in my home country, here I had landed a decent job within three weeks. A month later I found myself at a lecture, surrounded by beautiful, international group of brand new postgrad hopefuls; a class as diverse as they get. So - this is Britain. I love it. I belong here. At last.So what? Just a few things. Firstly, what I am trying to say is we need to realise the bloody immigrants come in all sizes and shapes. Surprisingly, so does every larger group of people, everywhere in the world. There are poor ones and rich ones; school drop-outs and PhD holders; ones with a special talent and others with none at all. The one common thing though is The Decision. All of us expats, I believe, had to stop at some point and decide whether or not the life weâ€™re living is the life we want to have. More questions followed: what do I tell my loved ones? How can I abandon everything I know and go back to square one? Am I not too old/too young to do this? What if I fail?From my own experience, but also from dozens of stories I heard over those past few years â€“ I know it takes a good amount of courage (and probably a little bit of madness) to throw your life away, and start again elsewhere. Back in your old country you will be labelled a coward, an opportunist, a daredevil, taking the easy way out. Here, in your new country, you â€“ and I mean you personally â€“ will be accused of stealing jobs, creating crime wave, and even causing lack of social housing. Single-handedly. If this is the easy way out, then I donâ€™t want to know what the difficult alternative is.The fact remains, that majority of EU immigrants in UK take the kind of jobs no one else would. Low-paid, physically demanding, intellectually unstimulating. I am not sure the public realises how many branches of service sector depend almost solely on people for whom English is the second language. My current â€˜branchâ€™ â€“ hospitality â€“ is built on EU migrant workers; about 70-80% of the people I work with every day are not British. The EU immigrants are also your nannies, plumbers, electricians â€“ and so on. Having said that, I have many friends, who despite holding the wrong passport, have successfully graduated from top universities, either here or back â€˜homeâ€™, wherever that is, and went on to have brilliant careers, working in the media, IT, creative sector or financial corporations in The City. Nevertheless, both these groups remain grateful and aware of the fact they owe so much to this country. We work hard, care about community, pay our taxes here and spend our money here. We contribute to the economy, and try to give back to UK and its citizens. But, apparently, we still pose some kind of threat to the welfare of Great Britain. How exactly?Maybe it is the fact I spent many years learning about other cultures and collaborating with international partners through art, theatre and music; maybe it is simply my awareness of the painful examples of xenophobic discrimination in the recent history â€“ whatever is to blame, I have learned one lesson: indeed, we are stronger together. I can see it time and time again, especially in creative collaboration: we need each other to make things better. What gives me hope in these unsteady times is the fact that for every hateful incident there is an ocean of good deeds and kind words, coming from Brits who make us feel welcome and recognise the value of EU immigrants in UK. During my visit to Poland in September, the most frequently asked question I got was: â€œare you afraid?â€. My response was: no, Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry for what this great country might become, now that some lowest instincts have been unleashed by the controversial vote. Iâ€™m sorry for all those honest, hardworking people, who will not be allowed to enter the country and make a living for themselves. Iâ€™m sorry I got to see how reason got defeated by ignorance. But despite all that, I keep doing my thing: I work hard, I pay my taxes, I contribute to the society.And sorry, my pitiful, hate-filled hecklers: Iâ€™m still here.With love,Polish vermin",NA,NA,5agdhn,0.999994488,0.999988977,Brexit,01-11-16

Consider, the UK's unemployment rate of 5% versus France at nearly 10%, Italy at 11% Spain at nearly 20% and Greece at a horrifying 24%. These countries are desperate to bribe companies into the EU as a cheap and easy way to bolster their economies.Issue is these countries won't have the will, or time, to get out there. There's no comfy factory for them to move into today and such a factory would be many years (and a lot of money) away from. Nissan supposedly considered splitting production between France and Spain, which would've taken years, that's how big Sunderland is, one single factory produces more cars than the *entire* italian car industry and it's due to get bigger now.Thing is, tariffs aren't scary as they go direct to the treasury, so of the expected Â£10bn we'd reap from EU imports we can spend half to eliminate our own tariffs to the EU. This is why the EU is trying to actively woo companies over (and none have so far gone) because the mainland is a mess and there's simply nowhere for them to easily move into.Exactly the same issue with the banks that aren't going anywhere, there's simply nowhere for them to move *to*, there's not enough office space and more people work in the City of London in financial services than the entire population of Frankfurt proper, let alone number of people who work in the financial services there.

For the second, yes, if MPs vote to 'Remain', that serves my vote, though it saddens me that we'll still be living in a fery split country. But, even if the the supreme court agree with this ruling, it is still entirely possible that MPs will vote 'Leave', in order to keep the good will of their constituents or due to internal party politics.

11977,3,TwosipsTony,"To answer your question, no we can't join without consulting. It's all to do with the laws like the European communities act 1974 and many others.To start though, UK law cannot be simply be deleted, it must be replaced with something else. And a new law that replaces the old law must be voted for by an act of parliament. If the UK is to leave the EU some people argue that when we trigger Article 50, the ECA 1974 and others will be removed, and therefor need to be replaced by something else requiring a vote from parliament, so this would conflict with the prerogative powers. However no, the ECA and other laws from the EU will be simply be kept with a new name. No laws have been changed. If the UK chooses to change these laws at any point in the future, parliament MUST vote for its replacement.If the UK where to try to join the EU under their prerogative powers, that's when it wouldn't be allowed. The laws will have been changed between leaving and 2025 that are conflicting with laws like the ECA from the EU. Therefor, our own laws would have to change back to the ECA, requiring consent from parliament.

And to be honest what kind of point is that? the whole reason we have Parliament is because everyone cant make all the decisions. We vote for MP's to represent us and to make decisions for us, we cant have a referendum every day asking every British citizen eligible to vote to decide on individual laws and acts. It's simply not viable. So we try and get as close to a pure democracy as we can and vote for people to do it for us (MP's). Now if you want parliament to get in the way of a decision made as democratically as you can get, because they ""should have the final vote"", then you are in my view blocking a decision made in the most democratic form you can get.And you haven't read my point correctly. I did not say that the prime minister can do what she likes, but monarchy gives her power to make decisions regarding National security, defense and foreign affairs. Parliamentary sovereignty is over ruled by prerogative powers.Quote the governments website And your words,They are not, we vote them in and if they decide to do something we don't like, we vote them out. Known as Democracy. WE are the British public are the deciders. And WE decided.And i'm glad you can except the ruling made by ""the guys who's business it is to know"".

With the worlds greatest powers being huge countries like China, USA, India, Russia, all countries with huge populations and landmasses. How are tiny European countries supposed to fend for themselves?The only way for Europe to stay relevant on the world stage is to unite and represent EU interests as a single powerful front. Being a collection of insignificant squabbling former world powers won't get us anywhere. We have more in common with the EU that we do with America. The UK isn't the big dog anymore, we have to align with a great power, and our choices are either China, India, USA or the EU.Personally I'd rather be an EU citizen than a Chinese, Indian or USA citizen.The US is rich and powerful but it's common people have shit living conditions, few workers rights and consumer protections. Everything there is privatised and expensive as fuck.I don't have to explain why being a Chinese or Indian commoner would be shit do I?In conclusion, being part of an EU superstate is probably the best thing that we could do for future generations.

Yes, this may not end up being a winning vote against on principle, but could affect the lord's vote on the subject.how it could pan out: You write to influence your MP, growing support will grow support, the nay commons votes are heard by the lords and seen as voices of reason, lending weight to a house of lords already on the remain side.resources: go to the https://www.writetothem.com/ website, enter your postcode and find your MP about halfway down the next page. Select your MP then write a quick letter. It doesn't have to be long, nor eloquent. Keep it short, simple, and state your mindTime: 10 minutesSUPPORTING ONGOING INITIATIVES:what: find initiaives already underway and support themwhy: it's a hard battle to fight. It's mentally draining and, in some cases, financially draining. Tell people that we care that they are doing this with us in mind.how: Lend your weight to the crowdfunded People's Challenge. Or you can write to them and offer support.resources: https://www.crowdjustice.org/case/peoples-challenge/ for exampletime: variesSUPPORT CHARLES GOERENSCharles Goerens, liberal MEP from Luxembourg, has proposed an associate EU citizenship open to nationals of a country that has left the union but who want to stay part of the European project and retain some of their EU rights. â€œItâ€™s clear the UK is divided, and many people want to remain part of Europe,â€ said Charles, who proposed amendment 882 to a draft report by the parliamentâ€™s constitutional affairs committee on possible changes to â€œthe current institutional set-upâ€ of the European Union.You can show your support to Charles by writing to him at charles.goerens@europarl.europa.euLOCAL MEETINGS / MARCHESwhat: attend, support, or organise local group meetings or attend meeting rallies or marches.why: there are a growing number of groups organising these event and it gets the message out that there is a point and we are not going to go away. Remember that there is no mandate for leaving the EU regardless of the outcome of the referendum. Our voices need to be heard outside of this information bubble. People need to be challenged and exposed to the other side of the argument.how: Try asking in these groups how you can get involvedresources: time: probably a lot more than sharing a few articles on facebookSUPPORT EACH OTHER / BE NICEwhat: support each other in here, and out therewhy: for us it's mentally challenging also. It takes time and effort to constantly be involved in these discussion, arguments, counter-arguments and general insanity we seem to be experiencing.how: if you find something interesting, or useful, say so. Like it, share it (outside the group too), if it's a call-to-action like a poll or a petition, or a new articleresources: all sortstime: as much time as it takes to say, ""well done!""NEWSwhat: sharing news stories, opinion pieces and editorials related to remaining in the EUwhy: 2 reasons - firstly news articles trend when shared on social media. So yes there is the information bubble we've heard about but it also affects internet searches too; secondly sharing information keeps these groups alive. If we don't keep the information flowing, people will stop watching.how: share articles about our cause. But don't just limit those shares into these groups, share them to your personal social timelines too. Try to keep it to articles directly related to brexit and leaving the EUresources: many online news resources including, Guardian, Independant, Mirror, FT.time: as simple and quick as sharing something on social mediaGET YOURSELF INFORMEDwhat: read articles and get information on BOTH sides of the argumentwhy: It's important to understand (or at least try to understand) both sides of the argument. How on earth can we be expected to have rational conversations, from a point of full understanding, without ourselves fully understanding the overall situation? Don't just stick to the usual suspects like the Guardian, Independant, etc (and yes, I know that the same list I gave above, but that's for a different reason).how: read articles and get information on BOTH sides of the argumentUNDERSTANDwhat: Try to understand other people's points of view. We are in an information bubble here and 99% of the time we hear only information which supports our own points of view. We need to understand how other people think, because without that understanding we can't beat them.how: Find resources, articles, news that support the other side of the argument. Try to understand them, even if you don't agree.resources: POLLS / PETITIONSwhat: influence others with poll results and petitionswhy: the result of a poll or the number of people signing a petition may not have a direct influence on government policy, but it's a process of winning over the popular argument. If I see a result (however unscientific) that only 16% of the population supports a 2nd referendum I am much more likely to believe myself that I shouldn't bother to pursue anything regarding this subject - as it's already dead in the water. Conversly, if I see a result stating that 99% of respondants say that leaving the EU is a bad thing, I *may* start to believe the same thing myself.how: online polls and petitions are regularly posted on these groups. If you see one, please do go and fill it in / sign it.resources: As and when they come uptime: 30 secondsMOANINGwhat: Moan!why: I've read a lot of comments from people recently moaning about the number of people here moaning about stuff and not doing anything about it. Well, the problem isn't the moaning - it's the lack of action that's the issue. Moaning has a couple of good points to it: 1) it's cathartic - we all enjoy a good moan and it keeps us sane, 2) posting keep these groups alive. We're not a political machine and we should be expected to have highly intellectual debates on all matters. Yes, that should definitely be in here too, but moaning is like talking about the weather - it gives us all immediately common ground on which to bond and actually get stuff done.how: Moan, on here, on your social media, on forums, on anywhere you cantime: moaning doesn't take long.Try to stay positive everyone. This is a process and we're not going to win the war in one day. We have to play a longer game and keep our resolve. The important thing is to take action. It doesn't have to take much time or energy but the more you make your voices heard the louder we are all going to sound.",NA,NA,5cnbs3,1.18E-11,-1,Against,13-11-16

12208,3,Stannoble,"I'm with you on some points. This referrendum and the Scotland one were poor. I think you should need a considerable majority (60% or more) to go through with a decision that can;t really be reversed. Considering the poor job they made of the Scottish one it defies belief they couldn't have done better on this.Sarcastic last 2 lines. The problem with this referendum is it didn't really say anything. 52/48 isn't any real kind of unanimity, it's the kind of variance you would get within a week. The problem is the whole referendum doesn't really say anything, so the only way you have to interpret it is we leave the EU.On that point a logical approach might have been if remain/leave get 60% that is conclusive. 40%+ we have a new referendum next term (approx 5 years) and same rules. Basically 50-59% is seen as undecided, see how things go. Then maybe tie Article 50 in to being within 6 months if they get 60%+, and approving the ref accepts the consequential triggering of Article 50. At least you have something to work with.So yes, at the moment there is no real scope for anything, you are almost forced to take it at face value. The people who could solve this are the EU who could accept the reality that their policies aren't popular but they are doggedly sticking to every last stupid rule. That hostility form them is part of what pushed me from a remainer to a leaver. ",d9z4w03,d9z0yw6,5cnbs3,0.147971312,-0.704057375,Against,14-11-16

If you don't engage them as equals and try to understand their concerns you won't be able to change their opinion. This is a large part of the problem really - the condescension of some parties. When people are treated like that the rail against it.Most people really don't even consider facts, it's emotional. Emotional arguments win. So anyway, the uninformed people talking about jobs,, 350m, bananas - those are the issues Cameron should have addressed I guess. ",d9z5aqy,d9yvrox,5cnbs3,0.039197229,-0.921605543,Against,14-11-16
12210,3,Stannoble,"Not entirely. I think a lot depends on timescales. I'm 49 and the fact that stability for the next 10 years is important to me was an influence in wanting to remain. I've considered how I would feel at different phases of my life. Long term I think Brexit will be beneficial, so if I was 30 I'd be more inclined towards leave. If I was 18 - remain again cos it's too risky at the start of my working life. If I was 70 - remain, better for that holiday home in Spain and the grand clildren. I think short term Brexit will be painful, but we will recover and have more control long term - and it depends on your circumstances. One thing I've found about life is decisions are rarely universally right or wrong, and if you look back on them years after how right or beneficial a decision was will change.",d9z5o4v,d9ygxmi,5cnbs3,0.00771117,-0.984577659,Against,14-11-16

12216,3,slackermannn,"Anyone over 60 is most likely alive. I am sure within your friends and family you can get some pretty decent information.I have personally bothered to find out and for what I have been told, things were completely different. This is to say that if you want rewind to how things were back then, you will have to rewind decades of economic policies. A lot of the economy these days is completely intertwined with Europe. Back then there was a lot of trade with neighbour states but nowhere near the scale of today. Generally I got a sense that there was a poorer economy but a fairer pay system. Also, back then materialistic attitudes were not as extreme as we have today, so maybe that had a factor but I don't know. No one would return to the economy of back then and I don't think we will no matter what... I hope.As for the immigration however things are much more clear cut. Especially in areas which have seen higher immigration. In spite of decades of mass immigration, the old folks I talked to, simply have not got used to it. Even the most liberal folks I have talked to can find it unsettling to see groups of foreigners in the street when they go shopping for example. They also worry about the culture impact, particularly around Christian values. All of this was never centred on EU migrants only, non EU migrants generated a lot of talk even when I pointed out that we can already stop non-EU migrants. That saddened me because apart for being unsettling to them I realised that there is really no solution for them.

It's one of the two.

Change isn't necessarily a bad thing, there will be new winners and new losers in it's wake.The problem is the different types. I have no doubt as I've worked with a good number of non-EU and EU migrants that there are some who come here and they're very welcoming.On the other hand there's a lot who are interested in abusing the system or there are some being abused in the sense that people want to stuff lots of them into tiny houses to make large sums of rent or want them being the cheapest of labour. This is something that could be fixed by some simple migration rules. I think the class system and the inequality of it in the UK does cause the most problems.

The tax authorities of different EU countries can then divide out the money collected from VAT they owe each other through inter-community transactions due to them charging  different rates using the VAT Information Exchange System https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0MwxpvBJwM. In this way selling to any other country within the EU is no more complicated wrt to VAT than selling domestically.

The Judges that made the recent High Court ruling are all funded in part or work(ed) for the EU so it doesn't seem very impartial to me. As for why leaving is good. The arguments are actually very simple. We want our own elected goverment to run the country, not unelected foreigners whose best interests certainly do not lie in the UK. Furthermore, we want and should be able to control the immigration into the country. Not stop all immigration, simply control it. The UK's infrastructure is pressed enough as it is without allowing countless more people in.For example, the NHS. If someone comes here and is diagnosed with an illness they will get free treatment. Sounds great, right? Well what about a person who has been living here all their life who can't get treatment because they can't afford it, or the NHS can't provide it. How is it fair to discriminate against UK citizens who have paid taxes to fund the NHS for years, yet someone who has never paid a penny into our system can come in and get very expensive treatment? Of course it's not a nice attitude to suggest we shouldn't help people because they are foreign, but the duty of the NHS and our govt. is to put its own citizens first. As for Trump, he has calmed down quite a bit since the result and has actually said a lot of positive things. Hillary would not want to mend the relationship with Russia and might have started WW3. Is he a racist and misogynist? I don't really think so, I think he wants to put his own country first. Clinton on the other hand is corrupt and sly, such as using money from the Foundation, a charity, for her daughters wedding and living expenses.

12255,3,BobsquddleFU,"1) We don't have a clue how Brexit will go or how it is going at the moment, I agree.2) The Judges were confirming the most basic principle of the British constitution, the concept of Parliamentary sovereignty. You don't have to be a remainer to see that if we are to return power to the UK we should do it in a fashion in keeping with the British system.3)We have elected representatives in the EU parliament, we have representatives of the UK government involved in all key decisions that are relevant to US. It's just as democratic as the UK system really. 4) EU immigration is around half of all immigration to the UK, non EU being the other half (obviously). Why would you want to cut back on EU immigration, which on a net basis contributes to the UK economy, in contrast to non EU immigration, when we have full control of the other half of immigration. Given the net contribution to the UK economy, is it not simply a problem with the UK government that the necessary funds have not been given to help areas with suffering infrastructure?5)The amount of people that claim the benefits of the NHS is tiny, and again a problem with the UK government, as we could actually charge non UK citizens for their use of the NHS to recoup the costs, but we simply don't, whereas other nations in Europe do. EU citizens also make up a huge amount of NHS staff, without them the NHS would most likely collapse because of poor management of recruitment number by the UK government.6) Hillary would not have started WW3, that is complete melodrama. Trump however has already gone and appointed a raft of Establishment and far right people to his team, not a good sign for the future or even the already distant chances of him keeping his promises.7)Trump also is guilty of misusing his own foundation, see [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-used-258000-from-his-charity-to-settle-legal-problems/2016/09/20/adc88f9c-7d11-11e6-ac8e-cf8e0dd91dc7_story.html) and [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-foundation-ordered-to-stop-fundraising-by-ny-attorney-generals-office/2016/10/03/1d4d295a-8987-11e6-bff0-d53f592f176e_story.html)",da2okks,da2n8dp,5byqr3,0.964945018,0.929890036,Brexit,16-11-16

12277,3,Twiggeh1,"2) The Judges were technically observing the correct procedure, I don't dispute that. The issue is that they are unlikely to be impartial. Given how biased the majority of the 'establishment' is against leaving the EU and the general mistrust of the political class, I don't think it's unreasonable to be suspicious when the public have been failed so much already. 3) Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmXJhGK4cr0I know it's not English but look how fast they vote on things, most of the time without a second word or even looking up from their desk. The problem is the media already know this is going on but they are so heavily biased and set against Brexit that they would never report it.You can't tell me that this is how a democracy works, they seem to vote how their piece of paper tells them to. Many of them don't even bother looking up at the room. I'm not saying the UK system in its current state is particularly good, but it's still a bit better than this farce. Besides the EU Commission make most of the big decision and they aren't elected by the people they claim to represent and speak for. 4) It's not a case of 'end all EU immigration' by any means. Of course the NHS, for example, relies on EU workers. But what is so wrong about wanting to prioritise British citizens in their own country. Why not train our own medical staff, something that has been lacking for years? How about tradesmen who are being put out of business by foreign workers? What about people with criminal records? The point is, we should be able to control who is allowed into the country regardless of where they are from. Why is it fair to discriminate against people from America or Commonwealth countries in favour of people from Europe? What about our fishing waters. Not strictly immigration, but mainland Europeans are constantly taking fish from British waters and ruining our fishing industry. We're a island nation with a tiny, failing fishing industry. That just seems ridiculous to me. 5) The NHS is full of middle managers and bad spending decisions. Is that the EU's fault? No, I don't think so. I'm not saying the UK government have done a good job by any means, but at least they are elected. People going on about how the High Court ruling is all about Parliamentary sovereignty is bollocks when none of them cared about it being given away to the EU. I agree there needs to be a shake up of our own government, but that all seems rather pointless when we don't have complete control of our own country. 6) Perhaps it is a little melodramatic, but I didn't see anything suggesting that Hillary would attempt to improve relations with Russia. Trump on the other hand might actually manage it. He certainly seems a lot more willing to work with him to improve the world rather than endanger it. When the west does nothing but provoke Russia and demonise them endlessly, how will that ever end well?7) If that's true then it's just another reason to hate Trump. However he's a billionaire so it seems kinda pointless for him to snaffle a few hundred thousand from his charity. At the end of the day I don't think Trump or Hillary were good candidates, but given how messy the world's economies and politics are, perhaps having an experienced businessman who seems willing to work with other countries (especially the UK) might not be as bad as everyone expects.",da46apx,da2okks,5byqr3,0.999445802,0.998891603,Brexit,17-11-16

12280,3,BobsquddleFU,"1) What do you mean failed so much already? We're leaving the EU now that it has been shown (for the first time) that the majority of voters are against it, I don't really see what you mean. Also, they would have to be hugely biased against the EU to even consider another judgement, as they'd be essentially rewriting the way the UK government works. I do not see the problem with the judges or the decision here.2) I don't have any context of how this vote was carried out, they might have been voting according to the party line here, which is exactly what they do in the UK, where many MPs don't bother to read the content of the Bill either or turn up for the first readings. The UK system is not better than this. As well as this, now that we are leaving and will have to replace 20 years worth of EU law, do you think MPs then will read the bill replacing these very ones in the video?Of course that is just assuming things, without context they could even have already discussed and debated the issues beforehand and ended with a vote on all of the issues, as they do have time for debate in the EU parliament, just check the number of eccentric, insulting speeches Farage has made there to see.  The EU commission contains representation from the UK government, which is elected. As a country which has an unelected upper house, head of state and currently prime minister a delegate from an elected government looks a bit trivial. 3) What do you mean by prioritising British workers in their own country?Well we could train our own medical staff but that would cost the NHS and the government much much more, and considering the government is cutting funds from the NHS then that doesn't seem very likely. The NHS would not be under the current strain, which is actually mainly caused by the increase in the elderly population, if it was properly funded and run and adequate social care was provided by councils which didn't have their funding cut.We can also send EU immigrants with criminal records back and bar their entry, it is included in the treaty allowing free movement in the first place, if the UK government neglects to use that power then it is not the fault of the EU.As opposed to discriminating against the poor and the poorly educated which a points based system will do? Any immigration system is discriminatory, it's just their nation doesn't happen to be right next to us in a political and economic union with us.On fishing, another example of people blaming internal problems on the EU:http://nffo.org.uk/eu-referendum/2016/05/09/fisheries-facts-not-fantasyhttps://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/griffin-carpenter/eu-common-fisheries-policy-has-helped-not-harmed-uk-fisheries-04) The EU parliament is elected...Defending the constitution and structure of the UK political system is not bollocks. The UK ever since the civil war has had Parliament as supreme in the UK system, even when in the EU. From my POV people saying that the UK system is better than the EU's then throwing a fit when they have to follow the UK system is bollocks. I think you're exaggerating the amount of power the EU has now, the powers of the EU are mostly relevant to the common market area, and our businesses will most likely end up having to follow them if they want to trade with the EU, no matter what type of Brexit. 5) What Donald Trump has hinted at could destabilise the international balance of power and weaken the position of Europe and the UK greatly, that's not exactly better than just having frosty relations with Russia. I don't see why you say that the west demonises and provokes Russia endlessly, Russia does exactly the same thing. It's not as if all these Eastern European nations were forced into joining the EU or NATO, if Russia wasn't a threat to them then they might not have.6) Well he also has a history of not paying his workers what are paltry amounts to him, so I'm willing to believe the hard evidence in this case. I am inclined to agree that it *could* be better than people think, if Trump suddenly abandons a great deal of his policy in regards to starting a trade war with China and ignoring the Paris climate deal etc, but it's all up in the air at the moment, we'll have to wait and see.",da4jeds,da46apx,5byqr3,0.86232291,0.724645821,Brexit,17-11-16

I've spent a lot of time since then reading up on the EU and Euro and I now have to admit that we are probably better off outside than in. A lot of people, myself included, confused the continent of Europe with the European Union. It is quite clear that the Euro is causing terrible damage to Southern Europe, and that the structural problems inherent in the currency cannot easily be addressed. Therefore it is likely that we will see some kind of unravelling of the currency in the short to medium term. The UK pound has been trading at artificially high levels given the indebtedness of our economy and the present loss in value represents a sensible and inevitable rebalancing of the currency. Once the turbulence caused by our leaving of the EU has subsided, the UK should be in a good position to begin trading with Europe and the rest of the World from a much better and more sustainable position.

Whilst the OBR is attributing something like 60bn pounds of additional debt directly to the EU exit, it is also assuming that the total cost to the economy is 122bn. Now with this additional debt, Britain will likely be close to having as much debt as GDP in the early 2020s, at a time where there will be significant shifts and likely costs to the level of exports. If banks lose trust in a country, interest rates can suddenly shoot up and mean bankruptcies of companies and require substantial further cuts of government spending. Have a look at http://www.tradingeconomics.com/greece/government-debt-to-gdp The Greek financial crisis started in 2007/2008 as a result of this and has since almost doubled the debt to GDP ratio, largely due to a dramatically shrinking economy.

But here's the deal:Foreign goods have become more expensive. My company pays most of its non-salary costs in USD, but because we have a margin and it's a hassle to adjust prices mid-year, we adjust them when contracts are set to renew. But my Locksmith who had to replace a door called me mid-July to tell me that his cost had gone up and that he needed to adjust his quote. For my clients outside of the UK, I still tend to quote in GBP where jobs involve a lot of labour cost. So the standard rates have become cheaper and I actually see a small increase in work coming through as a result. It's a short term benefit. I was also considering to bring a new product to market in 2017. This would have needed investment. I would usually have used: * Staff time when people are not busy - which I have less of due to slightly more work.* Investment from a partner - which is currently highly unlikely to come through as he is hesitant to invest in a non-EU country. So my business spending is rising because I have higher costs. My business income is rising because I don't invest in future developments and repurpose the resources to revenue generating work which has become cheaper for some of my clients.

I don't think it should be an ad-hoc or ongoing process, but rather something that is done *before* the bill to trigger Article 50 is brought to the House. The issue with letting the government get on with things before presenting a fully-formed deal for Parliament to amend, reject or accept is that it's extraordinarily unlikely that the deal will meaningfully satisfy a majority of voters. Giving parliament the power to shape the deal as it's made will be the best way to ensure that it is representative of the voters' desires.The challenges being brought so far seem to be along the lines of process rather than substance, ensuring that the process followed is unquestionably within the bounds of the law. I find it hard to understand Leavers (well, the Daily Mail at least) who froth at the mouth about this. What if May had already triggered Article 50, then it was ruled that she had acted unlawfully? *That* would be a serious barrier to leaving. Brexit is, without a doubt, the most complex undertaking in the history of the UK government. It will completely redefine the existence of our country, if not permanently, then for at least two generations. Once it is done, it cannot be undone in the sense of being able to return to anything resembling the current status quo. Once it is done, it should not be credible for anyone to meaningfully call the process or its outcomes into question. There will be detractors, and there will be unhappy voters.

12488,3,SirJoePininfarina,"As UK public debt increases, the cost of servicing that debt will go up for the British government. Taxes will increase to cover this (not corporation tax, obviously - they are a Tory government at the end of the day), so the spending power of your average worker will decrease as they're paid the same while the cost of things go up. This happens in two ways; firstly in an invisible way i.e. how it's happening now, with the pound worth less when importing things. Then the increased tax take from your payslip will start to hurt too.Some tax will be invented, a Brexit tax under a different name. In Ireland, we had a massive financial collapse that saw the introduction of the ""Universal Social Charge"" - we still have it even as things have begun to pick up. The British government will do this too because that's what austerity is all about.Anyway, this combination of high public debt and high borrowing costs (a natural byproduct when your economy's rating gets slashed, which will keep happening as the Brexit train keeps chugging along) is pretty much what a box of inflation says on the back under ""Ingredients"". Add to that less money in voters' pockets and I'd imagine that the wheels of that Brexit train will start working themselves loose as the track begins to buckle.

After the napoleonic wars where millions of people lost their life's (think 1st and 2nd world wars), counties didn't want to fight because fighting had been so terrible. The concert of Europe emerged (think the league of nations and the european union) which resolved to maintain stability between constituent countries.  The concert of Europe eventually failed because it did not give the freedom and liberties that constituent counties wanted also forcing them to make concessions they didn't want. My point is war hasn't happened because people haven't wanted it, not because the eu has resolved tensions. The eu is infact causing and adding to tensions.

The Government, for example, may not repeal a law which Parliament passes. Otherwise if the Government didn't like a law but Parliament did, then Parliament would never be able to see laws as intended. The Judiciary can review cases like Article 50 where the areas are grey. As it currently stands (appeal in process right now) Who can trigger Article 50? The Government. How can they trigger it? It involves repealing one of our British Laws, that is something Parliament must do.The Government is appealing the ruling because they believe that repealing the European Communities Act is an expected knock-on effect of their right to trigger. Therefore, they argue, they can invoke Article 50 and in turn repeal a law. There are strong arguments on both sides and I encourage you to review them. This is not about ""the will of the people"" this is explicitly about ensuring the Government cannot overreach its powers. If they lose, likely they will have to undergo scrutiny of Parliament to convince MPs that the deals they're lining up for us are worth triggering Article 50 now, and we know what we're getting ourselves in for. The Government doesn't want to do that because they believe that having that scrutiny might affect their ability to negotiate. It is also suggested that they fear that under scrutiny it would be shown that they have made poor progress, and that may delay things. They are trying very hard to do this before the end of March because of European elections.

Now we are in the real world, and guess what - it is not anywhere near as easy as it was supposed to be, according to BoJo et Al. The legal advice on the EU constitution and future deals given prior to the referendum was brushed aside on the basis that government EU lawyers were trying to prevent Brexit anyway. Similarly the advice of government constitutional lawyers  on the effect of a referendum and Parliament's role on Art. 50; they were accused of being too risk adverse. I'm sure that some of these Brexit politicians may have campaigned differently had they had the level of understanding they have now. The Great Repeal Bill alone is a nightmare. Replacing everything in the legal systems of the UK without missing out anything vital will take far far longer than two years. There will be massive impact on even private law such as contracts, some of which may be rendered voidable following the UK leaving the EU. The financial cost will be immense. Plus no one is actually massively wanting to trade with us post-Brexit.So Britain is now pretty much fucked. But I would not be surprised if it is all part of a greater master plan to dismantle the NHS, the welfare state and go for ever greater deregulation of the environment and the labour market.Let's be honest, the vast majority of MPs will never be impacted by Brexit, no matter how dire the future looks for the UK. But if you are less qualified and non-privileged then enjoy picking raspberries without a minimum wage and no employment protection.  Whilst paying for the healthcare you need because your back is buggered from said raspberry picking.

Others the more fatty corn fed beef has the superior tastes and flavor, Both of which are produced in Brazil and Argentina in such quantities that both land in the top 10 in world production.Also The US and China cant impose policies on us, unless we agree to an EU style political union, the EU imposing policies on nation states is the exception not the norm.Since you mentioned economies lets talk GDP alone not even factoring in trade. the two biggest economies next to the EU(17,110,523) we have the USA at $18,561,930 that's out and out BIGGER THAN THE EU WITH THE UK'S CONTRIBUTION. then we have China at $11,391,619 japan at $	$4,730.300. with them 3 alone we have more or less double the current EU's GDPalso that $ means millions of US dollars so that $18,561,930 is 18 million million or properly put 18 trillion just to be clear.and just to bat this home I used the IMF's GDP estimates for 2016,the world banks GDP rankings for 2015 has the EU a square second again ($16,229,464) to the might of the US economy (Â£17,946,996)but I'm a fair person and credit where its due the EU outranks the USA in the 2014 UN listings.But hey, remainers will still ignore all this because it works for them...",daw7cqn,davj3n8,5fz489,0.004180653,-0.991638693,Against,07-12-16

More specifically, the key Q, as my uneducated brain understood it, is: does the presiding government have unilateral / unfettered discretion to exercise the 'prerogative powers' where to do so would remove or restrict the rights of its citizens.Aside from this purely legal matter, there seems to be some mischief sneaking though. What is difficult to reconcile, or indeed excuse, (yet somehow has managed to escape the media's attention) is the deliberate making of false statements to the public at large regarding the referendum (or reckless abandon as to the accuracy of such statements) , and presenting these falsehoods as ""facts"" which, on  their own and/or cumulatively, purportedly operate as compelling reasons to vote 'leave', and perfect example, ref: Farage on BBC the morning after referendum result: (words to the effect of) 'no,  that 350M per week that we promised you, that is wrong, we cant give that to the NHS, we shouldn't have said that....' [similar analogies re movement within EU, access to single market;  this point alone is enough for now].I see it as a misrepresentation made to the british people with the clear intent being to induce them, on a false basis, to vote for brexit.  (   I  am prob wrong however)Considerable numbers of the public relied on these representations and voted ""leave"".  As these bases are false, the founding argument upon which many relied to vote leave no longer applies. It never applied.  Arguably, the results of the referendum ought be rescinded or at least re-evaluated in its proper context.  This need not be done because the results are NOT BINDING upon parliament anyhow - therefore they are not required to implement a 'brexit'.  Nonetheless, it should be addressed that the conduct of certain members of the 'Leave' campaign deserves further scrutiny.  In the meantime, the other key question remains unanswered.  If what was promised to us isn't actually ""Brexit"", then can someone pls explain what a ""real Brexit"" will be, set out the pros and cons, cost/benefit etc and we can be properly informed to make a proper decision that will affect this country's future for decades to come.The very fact that we have an UNPRECENTED 11 Justices of the Supreme Court sitting, along with 50 - 100 legal advisers, to make a determination -- isnt this justification enough for us to say that, yes it was very kind of you to invite us to have our say on this brexit thing, but if 100 of the top legal / political minds of the country are puzzled on how to move forward, how on earth are we, the people, supposed to figure out with the necessary degree of sensibility as to what is best?  That's why we elected YOU, as career politicians, to represent WE, THE PEOPLE, and ACT ON OUR BEHALF, IN OUR BEST INTERESTS,  when the going get's tough on the political football pitch, and not simply throw a hospital pass to the public ---- oh, here you go, CATCH, what do you want to do about it?? -- a la David Cameron.Apologies for the rant.
