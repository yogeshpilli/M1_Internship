There is such a thing as distinct nations and cultures, and they are different from one another and should govern themselves and be in charge of their own destinies. The most truly innovative periods in human history have happened in Ancient Greece, Ancient China and Renaissance, Early Modern and Enlightenment Europe. When we read into these periods we discover that a staggering number of the greatest and most revolutionary thinkers in history lived in brief, concentrated periods (golden ages). What most of those periods have in common is that they happened in regions that shared a common superculture but were politically divided into autonomous states. This allowed intellectual creativity. Political centralization discourages this dynamic by standardizing socioeconomic frameworks which gradually leads to homogenization of ideas and ways of thinking, then to dogma and inertia, which inevitably creates a more ineffective, inflexible and stupid culture over the long run. The fact that Europe is divided into many independent cultures with their own ways of doing things yet still share a set of essential core values and identities is its primary strength. It shouldn't be diluted by replacing it with a European superstate colossus where the same laws and policies are enforced everywhere, with a smaller percentage of the citizens making the decisions, which is what is already happening and will continue to happen if we keep going down this road.",d10g85l,49f3jd,49f3jd,0.890187581,0.780375161,Brexit,15-03-16

55,1,slightly2spooked,"I was considering voting leave simply because of unfair trade allegations and lack of EU support considering that Britain is their second biggest contributor. But then I considered what the international response to leaving might be. The EU is making a lot of veiled threats about security and trade - France claimed they would no longer defend our borders, (which may or may not be feasible) and there's been a lot of talk about how the EU might not reopen trade negotiations with us out of spite. Consider also that we've only just smoothed over the fallout from the Scottish Referendum - the SNP has already made it clear that if 'England' votes leave, and Scotland votes stay then they will push for another referendum within a year. Gibraltar has said the same, and Northern Ireland has said that leaving the EU might even disrupt the peace that we've only recently regained there. Even the US has said that they will reconsider the transatlantic alliance if we leave the EU (which is pretty rich considering all the trouble they've caused us, but I digress). Yes, the leave campaigns call this 'bullying' and say that such scaremongering has no basis in reality - but we have to remember that the EU is not made up of robots who will always make the right decisions regardless of their emotions. The EU is made up of people, people who have made stupid and vindictive decisions in the past and will probably not hesitate to make them again if they feel the need to punish Britain for leaving. Just look at the rhetoric already being thrown around by other europeans and tell me that animosity wouldn't get ten times worse if we left. We're being bullied into staying, and there's not a whole lot we can do about it in the current economic and political climate. Maybe in twenty or thirty years we can consider leaving again, but at least if we stay in the EU we have a chance of changing our circumstances, whereas if we leave we will almost certainly be made to suffer for it.

69,1,Rmcgeachan,"As a Veterinarian and (Neuro)scientist Brexit seems like a detrimental option. Am I right or wrong? Firstly, I'm undecided what to vote come June I really am. I'm looking to be convinced to fall to one side of the fence I'm sitting on. Please challenge / agree me. Secondly, like many of us, I find it almost impossible to find objective and factual articles on Brexit. The majority of information seems to be purely propaganda for each side of the coin. I appreciate a lot of the argument is based on speculation so it's hard to back up evidence with facts but references would be appreciated to back up you support.1) If you're not already aware then the majority (80% +) of academic scientist across the UK have united to say that Brexit would be detrimental to not only UK but also EU research. The quoted net loss of Â£8.3 billion doesn't include payments to non-governement organisations - such as scientific research. The European research council contributes a large sum (8.8 billion euro between 2007 and 2013) to UK research. The UK receives more money from the European Research Council than any other country. We would be throwing that away. Not to mention the possible loss of future leading researchers to UK universities. This has already happened through the recently imposed tight immigration laws to non-EU citizens. The UK might currently be leading in world research but we are sliding down a slippery slope.2) Only the top 10% of farmers could turn a profit without EU subsides. The agricultural industry would collapse. This is obviously making the assumption the UK government wouldn't match what the EU was paying to UK farmers. However as the UK government hasn't come out to say they would match the Common Agricultural Policy - why would anyone take the risk.3) Everyone seems up in arms about immigration. 2.4 million EU citizens live in the UK and made a net contribution of Â£20 Billion to the UK economy between 2000 and 2011 (reseach by UCL). 2.2 million UK citizens live in other EU states reduces net migration to 200,000. What is the issue?4) I don't have the best understanding of economics so I'm not really sure the implications on trade but it seems nobody knows. Will we still keep a free trade agreement with the EU - unlikely if wont allow free movement. That will make us subject to the Common External Tariff no? One benefit I can see is securing a FTA with countries that the EU hasn't been successful with but say Switzerland has e.g. Japan.5) Even the possibility of Brexit has absolutely ruined the pound. I love travelling; this has pissed me off. Forecast predict it to only get worse.GO!References (I've tried to include both left and right wing papers to give a balanced view of the opinions): https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/uk-research-and-european-union/uk-and-eu-research-funding/ http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/03/eu-explainer-easily-bored-cost-uk http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/02/eu-explainer-easily-bored-where-does-uk-stand http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/24/britain-eu-exit-devastate-farmers-study?CMP=share_btn_tw http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/may/13/eu-science-funding-the-uk-cannot-afford-to-lose-out-on-this-pot-of-money http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11967049/Brexit-is-a-life-or-death-matter-for-Britains-farmers.html http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/11968813/Three-reasons-why-Britain-needs-Brexit.html http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study (UCL research)",NA,NA,4dr1l0,3.09E-09,-0.999999994,Against,07-04-16

The post Brexit UK-gov could keep all those payments if they chose and still save some money.  Of course, UK-gov may choose not to but in aggregate we'd be better off and choosing not to is a matter of our choice.2) See 1.3)  Personally migration isn't a huge deal for me, though it is a matter of sovereignty.  Most of my international friends are from non-EU countries, the vast majority ultimately had to go home because they could not emigrate to here.  Guess I'm biased but being terrible with languages, like most Brits, I'd rather encourage migration to and from other English speaking countries.  The chance of me moving to work in Germany is near zero, Australia rather better.The Australians and Canadians have already seen to be receptive to some sweet deals re. visas in a post EU world.  That seems to me to be considerably better than what we got - EU travel and work privileges that I have no interest in using.4) EFTA exists, we could join that.  It's in the interests of all concerned to have some form of agreement post Brexit which keeps everybody happy, as net importers we'd be in a good position here.  It's true that the EU could cut off their nose to spite their face out of sheer malice, but then if they are prepared to do that then clearly they aren't our friends anyway and we shouldn't be in a union with them.5) Markets dislike uncertainty, and we're obviously in a very uncertain period.

(negotiate your contract with your employer if he wants to make changes). for the working class like myself, wages will increase due to employers being unable to bring in cheap labour from european countries like Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech republic, Romania and Bulgaria. shortage  of cheap labour means employers having  to raise wages to attract workers.  I doubt employers will treat people worse post brexit because most of us 'workers' wont allow it. we've become used to a certain standard of living and expect it. who would willingly give it up? and why would you let your employer treat you unfairly? these issues aren't necessarily tied up witb being an E.U member.

The much vaunted essential E.U reforms and concessions that  were 'won"" and now aren't even worth a mention in the debate!. for what its worth...my point of view.1) i think science and research in Britain will always remain funded if its interesting or relevant to a need. its one of our strengths. how much funding though....remains to be seen. but science has always worked well for Britain and on the whole it pays to invest in it. it sells worldwide!i don't think scientists  would stop collaborating either. Russian scientists have little problem working with  others and look at their political climate!2) im no farmer so cant say i know much on this point but the current E.U protectionist model protects bad businesses as equally as it does good ones. our farmers will need to become more proactive in their business approach because they already need to compete with other E.U countries within the E.U model and if they struggle now....can it be worse post brexit? at least the British government would be behind them 100% whatever happened and would be held accountable to farmer unions cause i can promise you that the French politicians wont be fighting for them.3) while our emmigration rate has remained roughly stable our immigration rate is rising. im pretty sure that the  figure you have there may be correct but tje trend afterwards has risen.

No such luck, since I didn't live in Belgium and hadn't signed some paper I was told I had lost it.The process to regain it was ridiculously complex and relied on South African home affairs to be speedy. in other words, impossible.My wife and I were not married at that time so I couldn't get a schengen Visa based on her Italian passport.long and short of it, we cancelled the trip because I refused on principle to get a visa.since then we have married and did end up visiting. but I still wanted an EU passport. I could either wait 5 years and apply for an Italian one or, as i discovered last year, apply for a British one based on old colonial laws since I have British grandparents on my mother's side.I don't know Italian and thought British would be a better fit. I went through the costly process and have now secured a British passport.But only a few weeks later I find out about Brexit.

164,1,com2mentator,"How far back are you going? Since 1973:*Two of the original core objectives of the European Economic Community were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and a customs union between its member states. The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU,[150] and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union.[58] Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.[160]**Free movement of capital is intended to permit movement of investments such as property purchases and buying of shares between countries.[161] Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow. Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom. The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.**The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country. This required the lowering of administrative formalities and recognition of professional qualifications of other states.**The free movement of services and of establishment allows self-employed persons to move between member states to provide services on a temporary or permanent basis. While services account for 60â€“70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas. This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.[163] According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#Internal_market",d2j55cp,d2ilfi2,4gk0qf,1.99E-07,-0.999999602,Against,27-04-16

People ask for these things and that's partly why they are systematically lied to, because they interpret an ""I don't know"" as inferior to made up stuff.Osborne just did predictions 30 years in the future down to the penny. I think that's just ludicrous and I hope the Leave side doesn't try to fight these arguments with counter numbers that also cannot be backed up.There are consequences of staying. You have to deal with these.For me the main reason is avoiding the continuous erosion of democracy that staying entails, and not being part of a clear train-wreck of an Union that will affect us either way, but more if we stay in. Particularly through the lack of border control and through the obligation to abide by laws and regulations imposed on us by an entity with clear conflicts of interest towards us. We will have to vote vs the eurozone on budget and lose every time. Then we will have to abide by it because we have implicitly surrendered the right not to by being part of the Union. See the second link above.Nothing to do with nationalism, all to do with sovereignty and representative democracy.The EU doesn't work like a coordinated organism. Never has, and I don't think it will start now. There are power struggles within the EU all the time, which disproves this analogy completely.No probs.

Is this good for me as a native? No. These are economic migrants who have no intention of setting up Base here to start a family or contribute in any major way to the economy. Sure they pay rent buy groceries etc but then house prices are being driven up and salaries down. This is not at all good for the millennial generation. It's an absolute disgrace if you ask me as the country is in such a bloody mess now where there's not enough housing, there's been an economic crisis that's lead to ""quantitative easing"". I don't feel being a part of the EU has helped at all in this endeavour and these are the issues I hear from my native generation which wider European immigrants here don't really care about. I don't deny the pay taxes and Contribute heavily to the tax system compared to what they take out. But then that money isn't making it back to the generation that now needs it in order to have kids and grow an economy properly. We say it shouldn't all be about money but that's the only reason these economic migrants come here. And if you want reasons not related to money look around you. As one person put it... the schools are full, the hospitals are full, roads, trains and airports are full. Housing is in short supply. We just don't have the capacity for more people as we weren't prepared for the influx of people and it shows no signs of slowing. The price of groceries is constantly going up and pay down.

The global economy is like a house of cards sitting on a see-saw, its fairly stable and so long as the balances move slowly governments can add counterbalances to keep the whole thing roughly level.  But if you suddenly remove a bunch of balance weights from one side and it can be hard to keep stable.  Unfortunately you dont even need the shock itself, the widespread suspicion is enough for investers to start moving their balances in anticipation.  Look at what happened with the US subprime mortgage crisis (which caused the meltdown, which is why we are having a referendum by the way), many of the mortgages in the securities were good, but because of uncertainty they were all marked as junk and panic ensued.  The uncertainty that you and I have so heartily agreed is caused by the vote, in itself could be the catalyst for financial meltdown.In terms of Greece, be careful what you believe.  The Greek government wanted to join EU vut couldnt because they had too much toxic debt, so they deliberately employed banks to obfuscate it in a way that would allow them to join.  After joining the next administration found out but didnt want to take the pain, the world economy was doing ok so they kept quiet.  When the recession hit there was no more hiding and of course the debt had got worse. All that really happened is the duped european banks demanded their money back, and when Greece couldnt pay they set rules to ensure that Greece didnt continue on the self destruction path they had been on.  Without the EU Greeces pidgeons would have come home to roost anyway.

If the businesses remain in the UK they will probably have to comply with most EU regulations anyway to sell products there.

Plus no, I don't think everything will be dandy, there will be so much for the UK to negotiate and sort out, I already stated above it would probably take years before we saw the full effects. **The EU gets pissed off and makes an example of the UK to stop the rest of the EU disintegrating?**I doubt this will happen, I do believe at first they might want to make things hard for us but you need to also remember that the EU exports a lot of its goods to the UK, if they impose heavy tariffs (which is pretty unlikely) we could just do the same onto them. Plus the EU should recognise its doing something wrong if the countries involved want to leave.**Exactly how many companies will move company registration and workforce to the EU?**Really depends, If production is cheaper with an additional cost of a tariff on goods then I don't see why the company wouldn't stay. Also with less of the laws and regulations the companies would be able to do more within the UK itself. Also, it's not likely that many companies will just fire the UK workforce and abandon the UK, we have one of the biggest economies in the world business wouldn't want to lose out on partaking in the economy. It's like saying when they introduced the sugar tax did the sugar companies pack up and leave cos it would of been cheaper to produce elsewhere, no of course not because we have so much market demand in the UK for those goods.You also have to remember that moving workforce and registration would be a massive cost to the business itself.

396,1,Snowy1234,"So, pretty much all the common misconceptions about the Brexit rolled up into one there.I too have been doing some research, and have actually been looking for a truthful and compelling reason to leave the EU. I've not heard a single one from the Brexit campaign yet.So lets deal with some of the main misconceptions first.**UK has a migration problem, and Brexit will solve it**No it doesn't, and no it won't. The UK currently has one of the lowest migrant movements within the EU, roughly 10% that of France and 6% that of Germany. Sure there are people camped out in Calais, but they have reasons to get to the UK such as family already here, job offers etc.Right now, Britain has less migration than any time in the last 35 years, and strangely that is going to be a problem for us.Britain has a huge problem with the elderly (a much bigger problem than migration). There are too many elderly, and that problem is going to get worse for the next 20 years.The elderly don't pay tax, cost the govt a shitload in pensions, use up over 60% of the NHS resources, and they contribute very little to the economy as a whole. Thanks to advances in medicine, the elderly are dying later and later, and costing the UK more and more.Now, I get it, they paid their tax and deserve more than they get. Many fought hard to give us Britain what we have today. They earned their retirement several times over.The point is that current taxpayers are footing the bill for looking after the elderly, and there aren't enough taxpayers. We desperately need healthy, young, hard-working taxpayers to pitch in, but guess what? We've not been having enough kids to do this. Since the 80s, the childbirth rate has been in steep decline. So, we have a double whammy of more and more elderly, and fewer and fewer taxpayers.In the medium term (20 years) we need lots of young people to come to the UK and work their arses off and pay lots of tax. We also need them to have 2-3 kids, get them educated, universitied, and out into the business world to earn big and pay big taxes. Currently 65% of successful new businesses are owned by 1st and 2nd generation immigrants. It's a difficult pill to swallow, but we really need them.Also consider this. Currently 500,000 elderly Britains emigrate to warmer european countries every year. Under Brexit, this will stop. Maybe something will get hammered out in the long term, but until then the elderly problem is compounded. 500,000 more people, every year, needing to use the NHS.**Brexit will solve the housing crisis**After WW2, the UK tore down the slums of most cities and went on a massive house-build initiative. The idea was to build millions of good quality cheap council-owned (and maintained) homes for the lower paid. Cheap housing means lower wages. Lower wages means better margins for British industries, making us more competitive on the world market. In the early 70s, British-made products were sold all over the world, and we had a thriving manufacturing industry. Britain, W.Germany and Hong Kong pretty much made everything. Then came powerful unions, and everything moved too far to the left. Then came Thatcher, and everything moved too far to the right.Then Thatcher sold the council houses. Great for making new conservatives, bad for Britain generally. Within 4 years, we had our first housing boom, within 8 years we'd had our first boom-and-bust, and Thatcher herself was a casualty. Suddenly the lower paid saw rents rising sharply. The rules of supply-and-demand say that with less rentable housing stock, the price will rise, and that has been happening ever since. And guess what? There's a new proposal to force housing associations to sell their properties to tenants, so no lesson learned there then.In a final note, nearly 40% of UK taxes used to come from industry and exporters, mostly SMEs, and with the rising cost of employees (unions, and rising rents) and almost no investment, we lost our competitiveness and then our industries. The UK taxpayer has had to pick up the tax bill ever since.Brexit won't solve the housing problem. Only long-term govt investment will solve that problem, and thats hardly a by-line of this current govt. They basically scrapped planning law, and allowed the countryside to be torn up and built-on. Only those houses aren't selling, it's too hard to get a mortgage, and the houses are too expensive anyway. So housing is stalled. The *only* solution to this is to build LOTS of cheap housing for the lower paid renters to relieve the pressure on the housing market, house prices will then fall.**Laws for UK residents should be made by UK elected MPs**Well who the fuck doesn't agree with that? This is an area where Brexit will make quite a big difference. Britain has never really been part of the homogenous EU group, and some laws don't always make sense under first scrutiny. I'd like firstly to address some misconceptions about EU laws etc. Way back in the 80s, a tory minister showed the party faithful that the EU laws regarding the production of Caramel came to over 180 pages, and he stood on stage throwing 180 pages of paper around, and he was hailed as a fine example of British sanity..  Then it was discovered (by a newspaper that actually checked) that he'd made it all up. That person is now an avid supporter of Brexit.An EU guideline, such as the bend ratio of Bananas, Cucumbers etc is created to help an industry across many countries to achieve a standard, reduce costs (and therefore increase competitiveness etc etc) and I can tell you that in this particular case, the bend ratio is set so that several industries can work together to create a field-to-shopping basket standardisation. e.g. A fruit wrapper a certain size can hold three cucumbers. If one of them is over-bent (it happens) then you'll only get two in a wrapper. So all the industries get together and find out the optimum shape that means minimum loss to the farmer, and maximum efficiency for packing, shipping, transport and display, then the EU creates an EU guideline that all countries can follow (or not if they prefer). It's all about efficiency and convenience, and yet it's help up by Brexiters as collosal EU inefficiency and control.So lets talk about actual laws.The EU has set some pretty stringent laws regarding the Environment and Pollution, Human Rights, Employee Rights etc etc. Often the papers describe UK court decisions, overruled by the EU. Brexiters will probably have an issue with one, or a number of these.A right-winger may consider that Employment tribunals, Holiday and Sick pay, Minimum wage, Work breaks etc get in the way of efficiency and simply add unnecessary cost to industry. A left-winger will consider losing the above as a step back to Dickensian times. They also consider that the EU has stopped much of Britain's stupider shit from becoming a reality.Brexit will suit the Right-wing thinkers more than the left.----------------------------------------I personally will be voting to exit. I'm under no illusion about how shit things will get for a decade or more, and I also am aware that it is the death-knell for British industry.However, Britain is trying to sell cars to Germany, Food to France etc, and that was never going to end well. We need to start trading with countries who aren't making the same shit we are. Perhaps the commonwealth. We can trade technology and pharma, with countries that can exchange it for textiles, clothing, food etc. And it would be really nice to be able to chop China right out of the equation.It's appalling that Germany has 10x the trade with India that the UK does, given the history, roots and cross migration our two countries have had.There are many reasons to leave the EU, and I've not heard one single one from those fuckwits on the leave campaign. And whilst we are on the subject, lets dwell a minute on Boris.For 20 years he's banging on about how great the EU is, then suddenly six months ago he's all about leaving??  Call me suspicious, but it looks very much to me that we're all riding his Brexit train to number 10.",d3k4czb,4l1bms,4l1bms,0.999947896,0.999895793,Brexit,26-05-16

Cameron is stuck, he knows just as well as Boris that Britain needs immigration to keep everything moving in the economy, but he cant say so because they have made stupid promises about managing immigration (on the basis that Labour hadnt managed it).I think this is a great example of the Conservative party eating itself alive, to score points off a Labour party that is currently so ineffective that it couldnt get elected.  So we really can summarise that the whole Brexit referendum mess is the fault of all UK politicians and we the people are being left to sort it out for them.Im deeply upset that a splinter group of nutters outside the Tory party have through brinkmanship brought the UK to the existential crisis its currently in.There isnt a problem between the UK and EU, there is a problem in the UK political system.",NA,NA,4lbme8,0.792238502,0.584477005,Brexit,27-05-16
417,1,jjador,"If you Love Europe, Leave it. The EU is like an alcoholic that has yet to hit rock-bottom.... it knows it needs to reform itself, but just canâ€™t bring itself to do so. It needs the shock of Brexit to reach its moment of clarity.In February 1992, after four years of hard negotiations,  representatives of 10 European nations  gathered in a small Dutch town on the banks of the River Muse to sign a treaty.  This treaty, the Maastricht treaty, would replace all previous rules governing free trade between European nations, and  would go further. Up until now, â€œEuropeâ€ had been a strictly Economic concept ; from now it would be a political concept as well. The treaty set the foundations for the EU as a quasi-state:   a European Parliament,  rules for new members joining and included a  specific objective that each country would â€˜convergeâ€™ its economy in preparation for a new single currency, which would be introduced in 1999. Everything seemed to be on track - there was just one hurdle: referendums. My journey to this point was not straightforward: Two years ago, if you'd asked me how I was going to vote in a Referendum to leave the EU, I'd have answered like this: ""I am glad we are having the debate, and I fully intend to vote to Remain"".  Iâ€™d hoped it would be a chance for Brits to vent the euro-skepticism out of our systems, focus on the very real benefits, and define our role in the world. After all, anyone who has taken a Ryanair flight can see that European cooperation and integration has been a massive force for improving our lives. Both sides would make their case, weâ€™d vote to remain and the issue would be settled not just for the next 2 years or 20, but for the next 200.But the last two years changed everything.  Though Iâ€™d  enjoyed the fruits of European integration I realised that I no longer believed in the institution itself: Despite all the benefits that European economic integration has brought us, it became clear to me that the political integration of the EU continues to suffer from a total democratic legitimacy deficit.  And for the EU to represent the future of the continent that invented democracy, that was hugely troubling. Even the biggest supporters of the EU - both at home and abroad - freely concede that it needs urgent and massive reform; and yet like an alcoholic that has yet to have a moment of clarity, it simply cannot reform itself.  Most of us, whether pro-or-anti EU  groan inwardly at each example of the incomprehensible bureaucracy, self-destructive waste of money, or legislative overreach.   And, though we all see it, and wince at it, and agree on it, time and again it proves to be impossible to reform. Put aside the  the big international issues about refugees and debt, I'm taking about the housekeeping: Does the EU need two huge parliament buildings? Should MEPs be required to submit receipts for expenses under 125,000 Euros? These fairly silly issues have been with us since the early 90s, and still remain unanswered and unreformed twenty-five years later. Iâ€™ve always believed that Government should be as close to the people as possible, and though (for example) the Welsh Assembly is as dull as ditchwater, its gives people control over how theyâ€™re governed. Whenever you actually give ordinary European citizens a chance to vote on the growth of the EU (that is to say, the people this whole project is for) they time and again say ""no"". The Danish did it in 1992 with the Maastricht treaty. The Irish and French did  in 2005 with the European constitution. Each and every time ordinary Europeans say""no"" the reply is always the same: ""Wrong answer, try again"". The Irish voted down the EU constitution twice, and the Treaty of Lisbon (the same document, repackaged) a third time before the electorate grudgingly swallowed it in a fourth referendum.  For an institution that sees itself as the zenith of democratic accomplishment, thatâ€™s a pretty miserable record. I have no love for the way Cameron handled the negotiations: Iâ€™d hoped that he would make common cause with the Danes and the Dutch and start a EU reform agenda that would  liberalise and improve the whole continent. The fear that the UK - the worldâ€™s fifth largest economy!- might leave should have put the fear of God into the commission and council of ministers -- Instead he came back with the sandwich crumbs. Say what you will, Thatcher came back with a 66% fee rebate; Brown kept us out of the Euro. This baked-in inflexibility is already coming under stress- The influx of a million refugees has shut down bits of Schengen and saw rolls of barbed wire stretching across the continent for the first time since the fall of the Berlin Wall. No mainland European economy has really shaken off the effects of the Global Financial Crisis, and youth unemployment rates of 25% are common. Just this week a Neo-Nazi nearly won the Austrian election. So the question I had to ask myself was - can you remain part of an institution that cannot reform, no matter what?  Do you need to be in a political union to trade freely? Do you need to be in a political union to cooperate on security? Do you need to be in a political union to have hassle-free travel across borders? The more I thought about this, the less I understood why we Europeans have made each of these (very real)  benefits totally contingent on being part of Political union.  And if I ever believed that the reason was â€œto ensure democratic oversightâ€ I was quickly disabused. Thereâ€™s no question - the EU needs to reform; A shake-out is coming, and Brexit might be what it takes.So if you love Europe and your European friends, if like me you want to see these 26 nations prosper and grow and succeed in their uniqueness you need to vote Leave.  Imagine if we vote to stay - any impetus to reform in will vanish in a bureaucratâ€™s heartbeat!  Nothing short of the tremendous shock of Brexit will shake the EU out of itâ€™s stupor and get serious about reform.",NA,NA,4lchb5,0.999999999,0.999999999,Brexit,27-05-16

If we want money donated to the arts or to research in X field we don't need a 3rd party to distribute it, we can give it to them ourselves and have it exactly as we want it. We don't need to settle.With regard to the democracy debate the fact that UK politicians are part of the EU is irrelevant, it doesn't change the fact that UK law is being shaped by politicians not chosen by the UK people. You can't argue you have some democracy so you are democratic. The presence of this referendum doesn't change the fact Eu laws are undemocratic, our presence in the EU may be democratic but while in the EU the laws it decides are not. Any influence over UK laws by European politicians is too much.I cannot understand the lack of faith people have in their own country that they would rather have laws decided by politicians elected by other countries than by their own. If you feel dissatisfied with the UK political field or the electoral system the answer is not to hand power over to European politicians it's to demand change among your own politicians. Too often people settle in politics, i'll be the first to admit you can't have it all your own way, but we should at least aim to get what we want.",d3mdykm,4kojr0,4kojr0,0.999997498,0.999994996,Brexit,28-05-16

523,1,Mister_R2,"After Brexit: How would the EU punish GB? I found this article in the renowned German ""Spiegel Online"" and I thought it's rather interesting, so I decided to translate it to hear what our British (and of course other fellow European) friends think about it. I'd like to apologize for any grammatical and other mistakes in advance, for I am not a native speaker.Here's the link to the original article: http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/wie-die-europaeische-union-grossbritannien-fuer-den-brexit-bestrafen-wuerde-a-1095228.html--------------Brexit supporters claim: GB would be better off exiting. However experts on European politics expect Brussels to set an example. David Cameron felt like a winner. After having renegotiated the EU membership for his country at the end of February, GB enjoyed a special status within the union, he said. Never is GB going to be part of a ""European Superstate"", never is GB going to join a possible European army, and still the country would be able to take part in the decision-making process. ""We got the best of both worlds"", Cameron romanticised. If one were to believe the Brexit supporters, one would get the impression that this would merely be the foretaste of a paradisiac future starting right after an eventual Brexit: GB being absolutely free from the EU's heavy chains, but yet not losing money nor power - the ""best of both worlds"", just even a bit better than Cameron's vision. However, the rest of the EU considers this to be pure phantasy. Politicians and experts on continental Europe alike agree in vast majority: If Britains were to vote ""leave"" on June 23rd, the EU was not going to hesitate to treat them harsher. ""The deserter is not going to be welcomed with open arms"", said Jean-Claude Junker, President of the European Commission. ""That goes for the stances of the Commission and of other countries alike."" Manfred Weber, leader of the Christian Democrat fraction (and therefore of the biggest fraction within the EU Parliament) shares the same opinion. If GB decides to leave, heads of state and government as well as the EU Parliament would start ""following a consequent agenda"". ""The British cherry picking would come to an end"", he said. Elmar Brok (Christian Democratic Union of Germany - CDU), chairman of the committee of foreign affairs of the EU parliament announced: ""We are going to take the decision of the British people seriously. If they decide to get out, they are out."" The British want access to EU domestic market - without accepting the rules. (header) Yet, for the British it would be of tremendous importance to keep access to the EU domestic market after brexiting. Currently about 50% of British export of goods and 33% of service exports (including the financial services important to London) are being sold to other EU countries. If Britain was to cancel its domestic market membership, exports would become a much more difficult topic. The following of certain rules are the premise to be allowed on the EU domestic market. And those rules are one of the main arguments of Brexit advocats. In Brussels the idea of the EU conceding privileges to GB after its exit is considered to be utmost unlikely. ""If the British were continuing to receive the same privileges free of charge, it would mean to destroy the EU as a community of solidary acting countries"", warns Udo Bullmann, chairman of the European SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany). The equity among members of EU domestic market would be the first good reason for the EU to not make any further concessions to GB. Apart of the EU countries, there are also non-EU-members that got granted access to the domestic market (like Switzerland and Norway). Brexit supporters like to mention the lesser scandinavian country in particular as a perfect example that exiting the EU would not be as bad as everybody tries to convince them. Nevertheless, if the British were to follow the Norwegian model they would not win a lot: - They would still have to pay contributions into EU budget - and with the ""Sales discount for Britain"" gone, it would most probably be even more than currently. - They would still have to accept and follow about 80% of the rules of EU domestic market rules, like (among others) the ""Freedom of movement and residence"". The Polish plumber (a symbolic figure which British gossip magazines like to root against) would still be allowed to move to GB and to work there. Those rules are not considered to be negotiable for Gianni Pittella, chairman of the social democrats in the EU Parliament. ""If the British want access to our domestic markets, it needs to go along with respecting the freedom of movement and residence"", he said. - They would not be allowed to take part in the elaboration of those rules anymore, because after brexiting they would have no vote in EU - just like Norway and Switzerland. The second and most important reason for the EU to show a strong stance can found when looking outside of GB borders: the threat of a domino effect. In the Netherlands, Denmark and even in France people demand their own EU exit referenda. ""Non-Euro-Countries within the EU in particular are going to watch very closely what kind of deal the Britains are going to get"", says Bert Van Roosebeke from the Center of European Politics in Freiburg. If the EU was to treat the British far too friendly after brexiting, ""the voting behaviour in other countries would change in a way we do not desire"", says Juncker. And that would be very bad timing for the EU: the Euro crisis and the ongoing drama in Greece have both brutally revealed the economic differences between the north and the south. And by now it seems that in the refugee crisis every country is only looking after its own interest. ""Finally the Blockade-Brits are gone"" (header) The EU definitely owns the means to punish Britain, because the process of Brexiting promises to be a lengthy one. According to article 50 of the EU-contract London would have to negotiate with Brussels about the exit. Brussels expects this process to take at least 2 years. In the end the EU Parliament and a qualified majority of the remaining 27 EU countries would have to approve the treaty. The debate about a commercial treaty with the EU alone could take several years (shades of TTIP). As the EU countries transferred the authority to negotiate to Brussels, London could only negotiate with the Committee. ""They are not expected to start hurrying too much"", says Brok. Besides, ""the British bargaining position wouldn't be too advantageous"", thinks Stefani Weiss, leader of the Brussels Bureau of the Bertelsmann Foundation. ""Usually the rules of commercial treaties are determined by those having the bigger markets."" Nevertheless, Weiss thinks that explicitly punishing Britain would neither be constructive nor necessary. ""The EU would treat post-brexit-UK just as any other third country. That ought to be daunting enough."" Brok would rather not like to call it ""sanctions"". He says: ""We are not going to punish Britain - they would just be getting what they asked for."" Some even believe that Brexit would not have any negative effects at all. Ideas like the long-discussed consolidation of the Eurozone or further closing ranks in foreign and safety policies would suddenly become conceivable. An influential EU delegate says: ""I have to say: Finally the the Blockade-Brits are gone and we can do what we consider to be right."" Summarised: The Brexit supporters claim that after exiting GB is going receive privileged rights from the EU. But leading European Politicians and experts believe this to be an erroneous belief. They rather expect the EU to set an example instead.",NA,NA,4m9wef,0.972925618,0.945851236,Brexit,03-06-16

[serious] Just today I saw this video https://youtu.be/mIjfyGIO4xAIn it, Yanis says that Britain leaving the EU would give massive credence to racists gaining power in both the UK and Europe.Before you answer, let me give you some background and why this concerns me.My parents both came from the UK, but I'm half Chinese. My grandfather fought with the British empire against the Japanese and was rewarded with citizenship. Further, I was raised in Hong Kong while it was under British rule, and still have my British passport thanks to the treaty of 1997.But back on topic. The video does highlight one key point that I would like to hear a counter-argument to. Would a brexit be bad for peace?I can only look at history and how unity between states and the formations of new countries has brought about stability and prosperity to all its people. China is the closest example I have, before 1949 China was nothing more than a mass of warlords. Now after decades of unity they are one of the most powerful countries in the world.The same can be said for the creation of the United states and the end of the 2nd civil war, the Prussians uniting to form Germany. And then of course the end of world war 2 creating the EU. Of course these have all had consequences: China is a communist country with massive suppression. America had the civil war and Germany....well....But the pay off of peace seems to good to pass up. Just look at what happened in Bosnia when all those countries broke up into their individual states.In the end, I don't want my children arriving in Europe to massive waves of racism not seen since the Nazis. Can anyone argue a point against this if a brexit occurred?Thanks for reading.",NA,NA,4mbx64,0.343762816,-0.312474367,Neutral,03-06-16

Apologising once again for the length, I just feel rather passionate but would love to hear other people's balanced views.Sweden has basically brainwashed it's citizens into accepting more immigrants and cultural erosion at all costs. Swedish is particularly vulnerable because they've not been as multicultural like the UK has been, thus we've had a buffer so far. I'm fairly sure that continuing the way we are on course we will end up the same way. There are so many details and nuances I can go into but allow me to note that many folks I keep in touch with are educated people, to degree level and beyond who are also folks who have left Sweden for EXACTLY the same reason and agree that the impression Sweden gives of itself abroad - some enlightened beacon of hope and prosperity is woefully unrealistic in the reality. What really makes it tragic is the self-censorship that people can't really state their beliefs properly the way that people can do here. Sure, we can also point out that we don't agree and we think that certain opinions might be intolerant and so on... the difference is that we have that conversation. They have martyred themselves for an ideology that they can't support in reality. A reality that are increasingly divorced in their attempts to justify it to themselves and the rest of the World.If you've read this far let me tell you i'm actually more on the fence than I let on. I know there's very strong economic reasons for staying but I doubt these are benefits that we won't recover from in light of the longer term wisdom of regaining control of our borders and making sure we have control over our situation - in the longer term this will work out better.

Together with a big Brain Drain of highly educated People towards the continent.

This will reduce the urge of a lot of the followers of current separatistic movements all over the remainder of EU.On the other hand losing the UK, will also remove the biggest hinderance for more European integration of its members, and the working of pro-european politics towards a European State.

While that party has shown (on multiple occasions) that it isn't particularly bothered to walk a fine line in those issues, calling the demands to impose immigration quotas ""Nazi-like"" is a hyperbole that drifts into dishonesty.It's a trade-off: not being able to negotiate on the regulations of the Common Market, but at the same time essentially gaining a blanket ""opt-out"" clause on everything else.

However, if we do indeed have such MEP's (who are elected every 5 years by UK citizens) then doesn't that make Brussels analogous to our own parliament? After all, we elect members of parliament and MP's who represent us in voting for legislature, and in the same way we elect MEP's who represent us by voting for legislature, just in a different parliament.So this, to me, isn't a question of sovereignty. The European Parliament where these laws are voted on contains some 750 members, and I believe most of the laws they enact that apply directly to the UK are environmental and to do with protections for animals and workers, as well as negotiating trade deals.

755,1,csdigi,"Sovereignty is not simply an issue of what laws we take from the EU (and by what process we can alter them). The clearest example of the current lack of sovereignty is that if two people in England have a dispute, and one of them gets a ruling from the high court, the other can still appeal to the european court. This is important because it means defacto, that EU law supersedes any UK law, and also that the appeal is from common law (the legal framework we enjoy) to bench law (a different legal framework). As an aside, you should probably read up on the actual process by which laws get drafted and passed in the EU, which is not quite as similar to our parliament as you imagine. While MEPs can draft up papers (and more ridiculous things called non-papers), they cannot actually initiate any new legislation (the commission alone has legislative initiative). This commision is a single member of each country selected by the president and council together. Each member takes an oath to act solely for the interest of the EU (not their member country). The president has the sole ability to assign a portfolio of responsibilities to commissioners, so the more they like you the more you will get. So actually in a real sense, the people who have legislative initiative in the EU have not been directly elected by anyone. Also as MEPs do not represent the same number of people in their constituencies, it means that some countries votes are unfairly skewed (as fewer residents can have the same voting power as more residents of another country). The classic example is Malta (who has an MEP for every 70k people) and Germany (who has 1 MEP for every 850k), effectively giving citizens from Malta 12x the voting power as one from Germany.While I understand you probably view the laws from the EU as good (workers rights, environmental etc) it is important to note that the UK often (as is the case with holiday time, maternity leave etc) surpasses the legal thresholds set by the EU (and are actually more generous). But it is important to note that even if you agree with all their decisions today, you might not tomorrow (it could be anything from an EU army, to a discriminative trade deal). As Tony Benn would put it, it is better to have a bad parliament than a good king.Finally, the EU produces the mundane legislature, not because it is a common ill that must be borne, but because pf the differences between a bench law (which sees unregulated activities as pseudo illegal) vs common law (which assumes rights unless there is a precedent of case against it). Most importantly is that the cost of implementing the regulation to our industries is high (in both financial terms, and in compliance work). This is a natural depressant on innovation (which is precisely why many of these regulations are lobbied for by larger multi-nationals). We don't actually require trade deals with countries to sell them things, in-fact we are forced to apply the common customs tariff only on non EU goods as it is a protectionist trade bloc. The work negotiating the trade deals on our own is much lower than the work of trying to get the EU to do it (the EU deal with Canada took 7 years due to some political discussions thrown in around visas for eastern european countries). The deal with Australia is on hold as the Italian tomato industry is not happy, I don't believe these deals should take a decade to negotiate, and I don't believe it makes sense to economically punish 25 member states because a few can't agree.Leaving aside the discriminatory trade and immigration policies (especially to the developing world and commonwealth), leaving aside the time wasted and the broken system of representation in the EU. The way to fix your own flawed democracy is not to layer another flawed one on top. Many people in this country (and others who came sharing the same ideals) have fought and died for the rights which we so easily gave away. All I want is the same as any democracy enjoys, to be held to laws which I and my own people have set, and the ability to remove the people who set them if we choose. There is no price I can imagine that would make me give up on that.",d46t30a,d46b8eh,4nmbnr,0.988504753,0.977009507,Brexit,13-06-16

Are those 1000s of people supposed to now go and find jobs in the EU with lower pay because they wont get anything similarly skilled/paid in the Uk? As one of the strongest economies globally I'd *hate* to think this situation could have been avoided if we'd been more in control and we're able to be more competitive. And this isn't the first time it's happened in the UK. There's been a number of industries crash in the Uk because of EU alternatives that (stupidly) work out cheaper because their standards are significantly lower. I think if we had more control we'd be able to be more competitive and more likely to succeed economically and fulfil our potential. Regulation (from the EU) is known to stifle innovation. The UK went on a startup drive following the recession, and my best guess is, in the next 5 to 10 years those startups will be better off out of the EU than in and better able to drive some serious economic growth for the wider population. I'd also like to think it could stop a bunch of corporations abusing EU tax havens by sending profits generated from UK citizens offshore with little/no intervention from HMRC other than a slap on the wrist whilst the general population is struggling to make ends meet in the mean time as salaries are driven further and further down. The general population has had enough of all the utter BS and shouldn't tolerate it any longer. This is why movements such as occupy wall Street began and why those sorts of events will increase in the next decade as the system fails them time and time again. We're better than that and worth more outside the EU than we are within it. There's also the fact that the EU isn't a democracy and the voice we do have in the EU isn't worth the paper it's written on. It's not high risk.

This artificial real estate economy, [drives producers and manufacturers out](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/7617/economics/economic-growth-during-great-moderation/), since high property prices do not make for cheap factories and affordable crops, hence the lay offs of workers over time by businesses who moved their production overseas.Then you have the attack on worker rights and unions by people like Thatcher, (heavily influenced by Reagan, your American 'cousins', or whatyacallit?). Which served to somehow compensate for Britain's relative economic loss in terms of production. As well as the austerity measures on your education, which leaves young people with a debt burden, if they can go to uni, unable to secure a profitable morgage, hence unhappy and frustrated about the situation. Frustrated and under appreciated (mostly when they feel that way) right wing politicians take advantage by this frustration by yelling big things like 'brexit'. This wins them votes and probably some shady US UK business deal incase TTIP fails and the dissolution of the EU is the better step for individual deals with countries to be brokered from the 'hawk's point of view.Now easy there cowboy (cowcousin, whichever you prefer),I never said I would want to ban the British, I simply said that if you want to pay foreign property taxes and working permit fees (and fit those conditions) and travel visas to get anywhere but to America (I mean to the right of you on the map), and you want to pay that to the consortium of countries working together on the continent, which have previously given you these things for free, then that's fine by me, the continentals will happily take your extra money, aside of the ussual flow of money that come in from being UK's largest tourist destination ;).

The British are not a 'race' they are a people of many different races and origins living in the same nation state, you know the thing that kept getting smaller in your case?

Migrants contribute a huge net gain to the economy and this more than covers the cost of any that dont work. We actually have plenty more national citizens that are a ""burden"" that migrants help support. 16.6% of UK born working age citizens are collecting a work based benefit as opposed to 6.6% for forign nationals. If it was the case that the treasury was buckling under the weight of millions of so called ""benefit tourists"" i might agree but it isn't.

It's not an issue for me personally, nor something that concerns me in particular.I'm not particularly a fan of limiting immigration. I'm a fan of controlling immigration. Controlling immigration simply means that we accept the individuals that we need, and reject the ones we don't need.I'm sensing something in your response which saddens me, it's something I've felt among many people with whom I've had discussions recently. It's as though there are all these issues being banded around by lots of people in the media and on social media, but there is nobody there to answer your questions -- they simply don't respond. So when you get the time of a ""supporter"" of the ""opposition"", let us say, you're all fired up with all these things you believe very strongly in, and you fire them at the person and unleash a lot of questions.I don't agree with everything that has been said in the media. I have my own beliefs and I try to stay objective in my beliefs. For example, I don't think migration is a bad thing. I do believe that uncontrolled migration is inefficient though.Would it shock you to learn that prior to the referendum ""battle"" kicking off, I was actually siding more with remaining than I was with leaving? The problem is that the result isn't going to affect me massively. I'm quite fortunate that I can find work anywhere I go. But now that I'm expecting a child, I've had to really think about the future. Not the next five years. Not the next ten years. But the next fifty years.When you start to think about the future like that, you look back at history, and you take a look at how the world has changed. Globalisation has revolutionised our civilisation, yet we're stuck in a regional trade bloc.How long do you think the EU is going to last? If the eurozone goes down, it will drag the EU down with it. If any big country decides to leave, others could quickly follow. Why is that?Really think about these things, just as a thought experiment.What happens if the EU disbands or collapses?What happens if it doesn't?What happens if it expands beyond Europe?One thing to remember is that the European Union is based upon the Treaty of Rome. I'm sure you know about Rome, and the Roman Empire, and the Roman Republic, and the HRE. We know about the first reich, the HRE.We know about the second reich, the German empire 1871-1918.We unfortunately know about the third reich.What I think we may be seeing here is a very strange, diplomatic fourth reich.Anyway, sorry for all the text.

There is a list of professions that the government considered to be hard to fill (some not very highly skilled) generally and if your profession is on that list then it adds a lot of points to your score. The problem is that companies petition government to have jobs where they think there is a shortage added to the list. In reality they just don't want to pay to train people, or don't want to pay higher wages to make the job look more attractive for locals. In addition to this there is the guest worker visa where companies can bring in completely unskilled workers, provided they have a job for them to go into straight away. Although rare, this does have problems when employers abuse their employees because those employees are scared to speak up for fear of having their sponsorship, and therefore their visa terminated. Obviously some employers like this because on locals would put up with that.

And i am most up for a long discussion on the subject.The eu and america are already forming closer ties with agreements like TTIP ,the Americans have already said they have no intention of a seperate agreement with us. The political leaders of every country other than north korea and russia have also spoken in favour us remaining. So the evidence actually suggests that the eu isnt holding us back to a regional trade block but is greatly suppprting international trade in general. Ill give you a task find 5 countries that have been receptive at all to a post brexit trade agreement. Where does that leave us internationally in 50 years? At the moment we all have the right to live anywhere in the EU regardless of age ,ability, education or intent. Most controlled migration systems have age limits or penelties making it difficult or even impossible to retire you might be able to find work now but when you are over 50 you might find this is no longer the case.Points systems can also result in all kinds of complications such as un married couples trying to move together when only one has the required skills. A controled system is also more expensive to run and administrate than the cost of unskilled workers in benefit payments. With our population aging and the number of elderly set to double to 19 million in 2050 along with the fact pension payments make up the largest part of the welfare budget at 150 billion if we control migration how do you suppose we fill this 150billion budget defecit by 2050 without increasing the working age population? How will we keep care costs down with limits on the sort of unskilled labour that usually do these kind of low paid unglamerous jobs.The truth is no individual has any idea what skills we need. They are determined by market forces that nobody could ever accurately predict. Skills based systems are also very prone to pressure groups that can cause artificial inflation/deflation in labour costs for certain industries by influencing and controlling the sulply of labour. Nobody outside of a few euro sceptics believe this is going to happen. The EU is the worlds largest economy. America has states and cities that get into dire financial situations and drastically different views on just about every subject but nobody expects states to start succeeding or the union/dollar to collapse. Its far more likely the UK will disband in the event of a brexit as England is the only country in the union that has a leave majority. In the event of a brexit some combination of Scotland, northen Ireland, Wales, the chanel islands,  Gibraltar etc could choose to remain. If it was to happen though in 50 years we would Probably go back to 28 independent states, with 28 different sets of laws and regulations, and 28 different currencies all wildly fluctating against one and other detering investment. Then suddenly having one set of rules decided by elected deligates from all 28 states starts to make allot of sense again. Or chances are western europe would join a US lead trading agreement like a more advanced version of TTIP whilst eastern countries might join the EEU. I think these two are linked. It wont happen with or without us and it will continue to expand. Initially states like the Ukraine and Turkey, will likely join. But in 50 years with the introduction of agreements like TPP and TTIP as well as miltary agreements like NATO and the ever increasing rate of globalisation and intergration between trading blocs will necessitate the creation of an almost global federation that will replace the EU and many other similar entities.we have already seen the begining of this with the creation of the WTO, ICC the UN etc. The idea of national sovereignty was fine when the choices thry made only affected that nation but thats no longer the case. If we want a peaceful and prosperous future as a nation we need to accept that occasionally things will happen that aren't in our best interest but do support the greater good. We can accept that now in the EU or later in some future federation of states. The entire eu debate seems to have been about how we can pay less in and get more out, what if every nation only thought like that in 50 years? What sort of world would that provide your child? Wonderful Under what logic is the eu comparible to the roman empire or any of the reichs in anyway other than germany being a memeber. Im genuinely really interested to see why you think they are comparible.",d4bjja8,d4akpjg,4o272t,0.999992978,0.999985956,Brexit,16-06-16

Personally, I think we face a greater enemy in our tory government than we do from anyone in the EU.

That's just personal preference though, I understand :)In your second paragraph, you notice I called the tories ""dangerous"", then listed a number of happenings that you apparently believe are worse. When i say dangerous, I am thinking of cuts to welfare that mean people who are found fit for work are having anxiety attacks and dying. Disabled people are having carers removed, and being forced to spend days stuck in their bed with no one to help dress or wash them. The NHS is being cut and stretched thin, putting *everyone* at more risk. And it's not even because the UK has run out of money - because they then turn it into tax-breaks for the richest. People are dying because of this government - people are not dying because of the EU.You are absolutely correct that democracy is supporting the elected even if you disagree with their policies.

It's absolutely a temporary dip but as far as ""temporary"" goes, it can have some pretty long reaching issues. Immediate consequences: 15% depreciation of GBP6-12% shed in STOXX600Who is hurt by this? High labor, export driven industries like Aerospace/defense and Automobiles would suffer most from brexit. There is likely going to be a stimulus to help these industries to not have to make job cuts. Medium term consequences: GDP drops, 2017 outlook turns into -2%, the first contraction of the UK economy in a very long time. This will very likely cause a recessionMedium~ Longer term: Trade contracts have to be renegotiated. An analyst I talked to asked some economists working on this in Geneva how long it would take for these effects to wear off and they estimate around 15 years to finalize every single trade agreement that's currently in place. As for your claim that the markets will bounce back up after a few years, I haven't seen any economists put that short of a time frame on it yet. Most are hesitant to put any number on but expect effects to last at least 10+ years. Going back to my original point, I am neither for or against Brexit as I live in the US. It's simply up to you to decide if the trade offs are worth it. Although the economic harm is truly ""temporary"", it's also not something to be downplayed like its nothing and everything will be fine and dandy after 4 or 5 years.

However, I've been following the Brexit pretty closely for work and it's basically boiled down to this:As a UK citizen, are you willing to hurt your economy quite significantly for the near future in exchange for freedom from the EU? Leaving the EU is actually incredibly detrimental to the UK. Immediate effects are 15% depreciation of GBP, 6-12% drop in STOXX600 (their version of S&amp;P 500), and a lot of pain on high labor, export driven sectors like Defense/Aerospace and Automobiles. These sectors are most likely going to need stimulus from the government to prevent job cuts. In the medium term, the UK will enter into a recession. Should Brexit pass, you're looking at a -2% growth next year, which could lead to a recession. In the long term, renegotiating all the trade contracts that the UK has in place atm will take upwards of 15 years. This will cost businesses a lot of money in the meantime. Overall, you can see that the economy of the UK will be grim at best should Brexit go through. However, it's for each individual person to decide if this cost is worth it or not. In essence, what I'm saying is you have to hate the EU pretty heavily if  you're willing to sacrifice your economy that much to get away from it so a lot of moderate voters might be for Bremain",d4dj7xz,4ol8uf,4ol8uf,1.99E-07,-0.999999602,Against,17-06-16

They provide more than all the unemployed being unfairly treated by the DSS. They provide more than all the people living in subsidised housing.

So they vote on the simple issues (immigration) and which politician they happen to like more *that year*..To be clear, I am ignorant also. I am part of that majority that doesn't really understand all the complexity of the EU. I suspect you and most on here are too.However, this is not like a general election that has relatively short term implications. Like the Scottish independence vote, this is basically forever. Most of us don't remember a time before the EU, and the relatively peaceful times we live in can to some degree be attributed to closer integration and more trade between nations that historically have spent almost as much time warring as not. Call me a fear monger if you like, but it is fact. We live in remarkably peaceful times. Why is that exactly? Like climate change, decisions we make now will affect our kids more than they will affect us, and they are getting taken way too lightly. This should never have been a referendum. We elect politicians and hire diplomats and beaurocrats for a reason.BTW, we have the same shit going on over here with Trump. Which side do you think he would be on?

Should a Brexit happen, experts are predicting a 15% depreciation of the GBP, making it much more expensive for Toyota to produce in the UK as they have high costs that would not be reflected in their revenues.2) They might have to renegotiate trade deals with their EU clients due to new laws/regulations which would incur a cost to the company.

1291,1,cluo40,"If you'd like some economic analysis, I've done quite a lot of research on Brexit for my work. The exact numbers I'm posting are what my bank's macro team is speculating but it's generally inline with other banks and the IMF's report they put out last week. First, in the short run, immediately following an assumed Brexit success, the GBP is expected to depreciate around 15% against all major currencies like the Euro and USD. Additionally, you can expect to see anywhere from 6-12% drop in the STOXX600 due to companies being overly exposed to currency deflation. Industries most hit by this are Automobile and Aerospace/Defense as they are high cost, high export sectors which means their costs go up (Pound is worth less) but their revenues do not go up (because they export to other countries). Secondly, in the medium term, there's a possibilty of a recession. We're expecting a -2% growth in GDP for 2017, the first negative growth rate the UK has seen since 2008. If this does not lead to recession, the UK economy could go back positive as early as 2018 but if a recession is triggered it could be later than 2020. Regardless of what happens, UK will need to add stimulus to prevent job cuts. Finally, in the longer term, an estimate from Geneva about how long it would take to renegotiate all the trade agreements is currently ~15 years. More important ones will obviously get done much quicker but it will be a long process. There really isn't much upside to a Brexit. A few companies in a few sectors like food or tech which have large revenues from other countries but low costs in the UK will benefit but that's simply because of their beneficial currency position. There's talks of potential attractiveness to trade further down the road but that's all speculative and reliant on new trade agreements. Of course, this is also just a temporary shock so in the long run, UK will be OK but it's not a quick 4-5 year thing that some people imagine it to be.

You might be right here, but even if you are our government is no better. For years they kept secret that they were reading everyone's emails and sending our data to the U.S. That's much scarier than an overspend on farmer subsidies!The opposite of regulation - de-regulation - is the kind of thing TTIP proposes. To be good for business, a lot of the time, it's also bad for social freedoms or protections. For example, I know the EU has attempted to impose fishing quotas and such, but the *goal* was to lessen the strain on global fish stocks. Of course business will be harmed - but I'd rather that than a situation where we can't even tell if our food has GM content because the rules about displaying health information to customers was 'relaxed to encourage business', wouldn't you?I'd just like to point out that here, you've used an example that could be said to be protectionism for EU goods over international goods - which you highlight as bad. Yet in the bullet before you talk about British industries being killed, also bad; but could be saved with protectionism! Generally though I don't know much about this so will have to look into it.

James Surowiecki (author of the book 'The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few') states that ""decisions taken by a large group, even if the individuals within the group aren't smart, are always better than decisions made by small numbers of 'experts'""For the purposes of this survey, I wanted to see whether the concept can successfully be applied to politics which leads us to the resultsâ€¦**Results**The raw data is available [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FsQ0oxi6XZS2cZo-S154B_eg4GZlcWGtIWyuRcGF0PM/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm).**- Which side do you predict will win the EU Referendum?**Side|Votes|Percentage:--|:--|:--Vote Leave|75|50%Vote Remain|75|50%**- What do you predict the percentage of the EU Referendum winner will be?**Side|Votes|Percentage:--|:--|:--Vote Leave - 100-81% Win|0|0%Vote Leave - 80-61% Win|3|2%Vote Leave - 60% Win|9|6% Vote Leave - 59% Win|4|2.7% Vote Leave - 58% Win|1|0.7% Vote Leave - 57% Win|4|2.7% Vote Leave - 56% Win|4|2.7% Vote Leave - 55% Win|14|9.3% Vote Leave - 54% Win|3|2% Vote Leave - 53% Win|5|3.3% Vote Leave - 52% Win|18|12% Vote Leave - 51% Win|9|6% Vote Leave - 50% Win|1|0.7% Vote Remain - 50% Win|5|3.3% Vote Remain - 51% Win|17|11.3% Vote Remain - 52% Win|22|14.7% Vote Remain - 53% Win|7|4.7% Vote Remain - 54% Win|7|4.7% Vote Remain - 55% Win|11|7.3% Vote Remain - 56% Win|3|2% Vote Remain - 57% Win|0|0% Vote Remain - 58% Win|0|0%Vote Remain - 59% Win|0|0% Vote Remain - 60% Win|3|2% Vote Remain - 61-80% Win|0|0% Vote Remain - 81-100% Win|0|0%**- What percentage of the population do you predict will turnout to vote in the EU Referendum?

Would you prefer it if we left and deregulated everything like america? Where their food has no standards, cancerous pesticides are used and fracking interests can poison water sources and face no consequences?I think you've not thought about what its like living outside of the regulated haven we have in the EU. It's better than having private companies doing what the fuck they like, they don't care about us, only profits. EU regulations are in put in place in the interests of the citizens.Besides, the working class are fucked anyway, the transport industry is the single biggest employer in britain, and driverless car technology is already being piloted in England. In less than 10 years about 3 million transport workers are going to be out of jobs. You know what, I'd trust the EU to roll out a basic income more than our corrupt incompetent parliament and house of lords.That's just one example, so many of these menial jobs are going to be automated in the next decade or two, and then the working class will have to blame people aside from immigrants for their misfortune. I look forward to it.edit, also i dont know what you mean by actively participate in, most graduates live and work in england and have no relation to the EU. It just makes economic sense, we have to abide by their regulations to trade with them anyway, so I'd rather we have a say on the regulations by staying in as opposed to being out of the decision making process like Norway and still having to abide by their rules.Also I wouldn't mind if we left, us middle class yuppies you hate so much are the only fuckers that can afford to leave and make bank as ex pat's around the world.

1460,1,endelikt,"""At least I'm moving up in the world""; is the most disgusting and out of touch thing I've ever seen written here on reddit. You're implying that the fact you were able to go to university was purely a fact of your obviously astonishing brainpower and not the fact that you were in a comfortable lower class existence that undoubtedly viewed a university education as an 'out'. If you don't believe that you're an exception to the circumstance then look around you and ask why doesn't everyone have a university degree and simply 'enter the middle class'? If your answer is ""because they're thick and I'm not"" then you're a fucking sheltered moron.There is no reason that Britain can not and would not introduce common sense regulation into the workplace that keeps workers safe, protects the environment, keeps dangerous chemicals out of pretty much anything and maintains high standards - I feel we could achieve all those goals far quicker and with better workplace integration than anything offered from the EU because we've reached the point politically in the UK where demanding those rights is considered a given and either of the major political parties would be suicidal in not enshrining those principles in a post Brexit UK.Many tradesmen I've spoken to have said that with each EU regulation regarding their trade to come in has increased their expenditure greatly. Lets look at water system fittings - are the old British specification fittings any worse than the type mandated for use by the EU? The answer is no, the difference is very little except the EU mandated ones cost three times as much and are interchangeable with the German water system (that isn't even sold in this country). This might not seem like a big deal as one example (because as one example it isn't), but this is a good example of the bureaucratic shite that many labourers of various trades have to deal with each and every day with no logical reason as to why and there is very little they can do about it. This is why they are voting to leave the EU so they can escape the idiocy of rules passed by people who have no idea of the long running effects of those laws on the people who it affects the most.All your spiel about the EU regulations being in favour of citizens is propaganda at best. Goldman Sachs, Barclays and HSBC are all funding the Remain campaign without a clear definition of their motives which, spoiler alert, haven't generally been great for the average UK citizen. The EU is an outdated idea that has swelled into a colossal money and power sink that is both corrupt and unaccountable. Other countries are simply not playing along and it's naive to think that this is a situation that can improve.The apparent disgust you have for 'menial' tasks just shows how much of a snob you really are; you're using this referendum as a way to spite the current political party of the UK, and I hate to break it to you, but no matter how much you earn in whatever career you end up doing - you'll always be working class to everyone else because it'll no doubt be painfully obvious. I really think you're the type of prick that we could do without in this world, and I feel even better about voting leave because of you.

Britain probably could introduce common sense regulation, but the EU already has it, so why leave. Also a lot of pre Eu boilers had a habit of blowing up? They've all been replaced now hence the lack of boiler explosions lol. You talk about people getting what they ask for, well, look at immigration, the thing most brexit voters care about. Conservatives promised to reduce it drastically and its INCREASED LOL. So much for getting what you asked for, another one that sticks in my memory is Uni fees, something most people were opposed to but it got put through anyway.The British government is corrupt, dismantling public institutions and selling them off cheap to Cameron's old mates, examples include the Royal mail and the NHS. The EU doesn't indulge in such blatant crony capitalism.I don't know anything about water fittings, but if that is true, then yeh, it's dumb, but large systems are inherently wasteful, its a sacrifice worth making to be part of such a lucrative market. Also I'd say the boiler thing is more growing pains, signs of us still integrating into the EU, things like that won't be a problem if we whole heartedly integrate.My spiel about EU regulations is propaganda? How though, we in the EU are some of the worlds most fortunate people, we live longer , healthier and happier lives than Americans, people with a much higher GDP per capita than us. What accounts for that difference? Regulations on food, medical care, health and safety, all either created or enhanced by EU regulations.Goldman Sachs and all the big banks have global HQ's in London, its the financial capital of the world, maybe they want to maintain full access to other financial centres like Paris that are in the EU?

The rest of the world already has enough semi skilled labour...As a budding young professional, I've never met anyone that has laughed at the EU lol.

Also half of them do STEM subjects which have nothing to do with politics or literature, so where is half the student population being indoctrinated when they spend their day learning about Thermodynamics and not marxism?Again, uni students are disproportionately middle class. Middle class people don't do too badly under conservatives, the working class get shafted. The only reason uni students are left leaning is because they are compassionate for other people. If you looked at the demographics in my last post, I think it's pretty obvious that the class of people who want to remain probably pay a shit ton more into the system than those who want to leave. Graduates earn about Â£20,000 a year more than non graduates, that extra money is taxed higher than the average wage of Â£21,000.

It is absolutely true that signing up for a membership in the EU means you will give up a bit of your sovereignty. While some believe this is for the greater good, others believe it's time to stop and leave. In terms of how this will affect other countries, if Brexit happens, in the short term most of the negative consequences will be focused on the UK. However, since UK is such a huge market, a shrinking economy, potential recession, and increased global market volatility will all harm the global economy as well. To what extent? I don't know. It's really hard to say because so much of Brexit is speculative. How long will it take for UK to get back on their feet? How long will it take to renegotiate trade agreements? Will there even be a recession? How much stimulus will the government need to pour into the country to prevent job cuts? If you're outside the UK, life will most likely continue on as usual. In fact, it might even be a bit cheaper for people to visit since the pound will depreciate ~15%. The main affect will just be concentrated in the global markets.

Not only does it allow people from across Europe (who fully accept the interests of the EU trump the interests of the UK) to alter UK law but the system by which it does it is terrible. The elected officials hold very little power and the real power is held by the lawmakers who are not answerable to the people. It is effectively the opposite of the UK, imagine if the House of commons and lords swapped roles and the main executive power was handed to the unelected bureaucrats. We love to complain about unelected people having power when it comes to the house of lords but we are fine when they have all the power in the EU. Not to mention lobbying which is basically sanctioned bribery by which large businesses pressure the EU to politically support them (no wonder so many want to stay in).The EU fully admits their goals is to continually increase European political and economic integration. The stay campaigners claim to have secured Britain exemption but it is ridiculous to think this will continue in the long run. The EU continues to bring it's other countries together and in the future Britain will not be able to remain on the outside. The Eu is already on the path to becoming a state, do people really think there be a United Europe plus Britain. We will either need to integrate or leave. Politically and culturally I feel we have much stronger ties to commonwealth countries than to europe.The EU's policy on immigration is a joke and supports the poorer weaker countries in the EU at the expense of the stronger ones. As one of the stronger countries we gain least from free movement because our population has a much smaller incentive to emigrate because we don't need to look to other countries for employment. Should we leave we would still be able to attract the desirable immigrants who fill the roles we need while turning away those we don't. Cameron loves to bring up how we can send people away if they don't get a job but how expensive and difficult is it to keep track of all these people, much easier not to let them in in the first place. Our double standards when it comes to immigration is embarrassing and hurts the UK. Currently we have high standards for non EU immigrants and none for EU immigrants, we are turning away skilled immigrants from the rest of the world to make space for unskilled Europeans. The stay campaign always point out how much immigrants make for the country but this number would be even higher if we kept out the unskilled ones.This is not a decision we should put off and there is no status quo option. The EU has a very clear trajectory and it is only going to become further integrated. As the Eu continues to bind europe together the concerns about leaving will only get stronger despite the growing reasons to leave (higher relative economic growth outside the EU).

An expert may know their field but that doesn't make them politically sensible or unbiased or ensure that their ideas match the people they should represent. There is more to politics than raw numbers, values are equally important and in this regard an expert is no more qualified than your average citizen. The commission however is not. We wouldn't tolerate the house of lords making our laws (even if MPs could vote on it), I won't support the Commission doing it. Governing systems need oversight to ensure the people in power don't abuse it but the core power should be in the hands of the officials directly elected by the people. The closer the power reflects the desires of the people the fairer the system.If the tories do this and people still support them that is short sightedness and a failing of the voters not a flaw in the system. The Uk's accountability is the fact that every GE people can choose to remove the people in power and replace them with whoever they like. If they choose not to use the system then that isn't an argument that it doesn't exist. If the Tories get away with damaging the NHS and are reelected there is no one to blame but ourselves.

In a single market, you need the whole thing to move together, or else it's simply not a single market anymore. The whole point of a single market is that non-tariffs trade barriers are  removed (in other words, harmonizing national regulations between members), so it works against itself if regulatory disparities emerge. Of course, you can very well argue that the European single market is still very patchworky (with notable disunity in services and the digital industry), and as such that not everything *has* to be made unanimously; but still, having different members start doing things in their own corner is a pretty bad habit to adopt (if a fully integrated the single market really is the goal). There is an alternative whoever, namely the EFTA, which is (almost completely) in the EEA *and* can independently sign trade agreements with third countries, both as standalone members and as the entirety of the EFTA. This was a compromise agreed upon when drawing up the EEA agreement (though the EFTA is also not fully integrated into the single market, with notable exceptions in fisheries and agriculture).On a personal note: I believe it would generate less political resistance if the EU aimed first and foremost for regulatory compatibility, instead of hard top-down harmonization in every economic sector imaginable (e.g. combined administrative procedures, extensive cooperation between the individual authorities of the different members, but without necessarily forcing the procedures themselves to be the same - just compatible).

Also, whilst some industry relies on funding from the EU (which we can at least partially replace), the EU has also negatively affected industry. The Common Fisheries Policy has ruined our fishing industry (Norway decided to not adopt it and their fishing industry is thriving) and food prices were increased by EU protectionism (tariffs on food imported from outside the EU). Infact, the Common Agricultural Policy has resulted in a large amount of surplus food being destroyed due to no respect for supply and demand.

The countries of the eu are too closely linked for the decisions of one not to effect the others. For example if one country subsidises an industry it will be able to unfairly compete with the same industry in other countries. Countries might be friends but you can be 100% sure they will react if your decisions are effecting them. Take german cars if the uk started to subsidies car manufacturers they would be able to unfairly compete with german products. Germany would then impose  a tax on imports from Britain to address this issue and britian would do the same to Germany. This is called a trade war and is why you set rules and follow them even if occasionally its not in your immediate interest because its always in your long term intrest. Companies aren't going to invest in foreign markets unless they have legally binding agreements in place to protect those investments. The idea trade or other decisions being made by mutual non binding agreements would be a disaster.Think about it for a moment.

You have to understand, the entire point is to have similar regulations and market rules between all it's members. In that respect, allowing individual members to autonomously manage trade agreements with third countries is simply, for purely technical reasons, dangerous: if for instance Belgium imposes quotas and taxes on Chinese steel because they believe it is unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government to dumping prices and is a threat to the indigenous siderurgy industry; than they cannot let e.g. Spain sign a free trade agreement with China that includes ironworks, because that would give China access to the Belgian market through Spain. It's as if Belgium (and all the other members of the single market) had signed the fta with China.

1575,1,Nobody_Anybody,"What Brexit and the EU really is about, saving the most important for last. The thing is.. working together is not bad.. heck itâ€™s really good, but what you should remember is that the EU is just !one way of working together! and according to some not a very good one, while other seem to be fine with it.I see many politicians referring to the EU as â€˜Europeâ€™ simply because this hides what the EU is and gives it more the idea of countries working together. But that is not what the EU is.. the EU is not â€˜working togetherâ€™, the EU is â€˜a institute with rules that describe how we work together / do thingsâ€™. There are other ways we can also work together.Why do you need some big central expensive, pretty undemocratic and mainly ruled by the lobby governmental institution? (The EU)In Europe, and outside of Europe we should all work together but also by our own rules.If the UK want to set up a trade agreement treaty with Ukraine they can do so.. They might also ask other befriended countries to join in. Some might, some might not, some might but have their own separate conditions.How it works nowâ€¦ Well with normal trade agreements you have no say in the matter anymore anyway. You gave away this power with the Lisbon treaty. You know, the treaty that the Dutch voted away and got anyway. For more information see: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2010/october/tradoc_146719.pdfNow of course you may say.. Well trade is good so itâ€™s fine that we donâ€™t have a say in the matter. Of course that is a little short sighted. Sure trade is good, but you might still want to allow for some things and donâ€™t allow for others because thatâ€™s how you do things in your country. For example, you might have (possibly new) rules (possibly implemented after the treaty did go into action) about how farm-animals should be handled. You might then also want to only allow imported meat to be from animals being handled in that way. So even if you are in favor of trade, you still might want to have a say about the trade agreements. But this is old news as you donâ€™t have a say in the matter anymore anyway.But letâ€™s say you want to set up a treaty about something that you still have something to say about. That is why I took the Ukraine treaty because itâ€™s about more as â€˜justâ€™ trade meaning we have something to say about it. Why do all countries have to agree? Why do all countries have to have the same agreement? All countries (well politicians) where is favor of treaty with Ukraine. However the Dutch people (again those Dutch) where able to enforce a referendum. Yes literally, the people enforced it, it was not the politicians who asked the people. Then they voted against. A perfect example how a undemocratic treaty (people where against it) would have been implemented. Luckily the Dutch people were able to stop it.. or not? The Dutch law says that the Dutch government has two options.. They can ignore the people or they cancel the law (a law has to be passed to accept the treaty) but whatever they do, they have to do t as soon as possible. Of course the Dutch government did go for the non-existing option 3. They wait because they do not want to influence with Brexit, by doing so they break their own law.So this is an example how things go in reality. But more importantâ€¦ Why the heck does it even matter if a country wants something else? If the Dutch donâ€™t want this treaty or want other rules then let them. Why do all countries have to agree? Well that is how the EU works. This is the EU! There is an option where the Dutch donâ€™t join the treaty, but that has then be part of the deal that every country signs.In the debates you see all these arguments about immigration and the spending of money, but thatâ€™s all irrelevant. A Brexit is not about more or less immigrants, itâ€™s not about if immigration is good or bad, itâ€™s not about if you should give more or less money to Greece. That is all irrelevant. That are just items that are currently hot and so being dragged into this discussions. At best they are good examples, but what itâ€™s really about is the ability to have your own say in the matter (without having to agree with all other EU members and probably the most important, with the ability to change your mind!). If the UK wants more immigrants then allow them to come, you want less? Donâ€™t allow them. You want to help Greece? Give them money, you donâ€™t? Donâ€™t give them money. Itâ€™s just about who decides, and how. Not about what to decide. Let me shortly also go into economic welfare. There is a lot of talk about how leaving the EU would result in huge economic problems. Of course this type of scare talk has been used in the past. Guy Verhofstadt ( leader of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. But you knew that right, just as you know the leaders of the political parties in your own country) talked about a continental crisis if the Dutch would vote against the Ukraine treaty. The day after they voted against, Guy was looking for a nice car http://www.geenstijl.nl/archives/images/IMG_50071.html . That is how a continental crisis looks like, just so you know! So take all this scare talk with a grain of salt. Big companies are telling you the economy would break down?. Well they have a lot to say in the EU using the lobby, so of course they want to scare you. I cannot say if the UK will have some economical difficulties just after a Brexit, or that it will become very rich non-EU country (like a Switzerland). But we know that not being part of the EU does not mean your will be some poor country. So again, take all the scare-talk with a grain of salt. Of course, but keep working together with other countries. Also if you leave.Back to what itâ€™s really about. As you have seen, some powers have already been given away to the EU (for example trade agreements), some other can be taken away because not all EU law needs to be unanimous. However the more important decisions that impact your national law still require the national parliament to agree with it. So that is good right? Sure it is.. But how about the right to change your mind? The Dutch voted again the EU constitution, so the EU changed the name and remove some nonsense. And it was introduced as the Lisbon Treaty. The Dutch never had the ability to have another say about itâ€¦ Or well, they sort of did. With the national elections they were able to show what they did think about the party most responsible for accepting this treaty. And they did. Have a look: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/nl/timeline/a8eb9c8d955b2bc19286b9d7d0d814ef.png  (just for the record, itâ€™s the biggest drop you see there). But of course it does not matter. They might have used all their democratic power they had to show they were against it, itâ€™s here and getting it removed again means getting all EU-members to agree. Getting rid of a national constitutional law is easier. You see the same with other countries.. So enough with the Dutch for now. Ireland voted against it the first time.. Then they were asked again and voted in favor. But they will never be ask a third time, because you cannot (easily) change your mind! This is an extremely dangerous part of the EU as it means itâ€™s easier to lose power then to get it back. These agreements are not non-committal or of a temporary nature.Imagine you would only have the ability to select your national government once, or at least select your national laws once. That would be really bad and very undemocratic. The ability to change your mind is one of the most important elements of any democracy! Doing that inside the EU is possible but extremely hard. Basically the only way to change your mind, is to leave the EU.",NA,NA,4p9q0p,1,1,Brexit,22-06-16

Itâ€™s saying that whatever the future holds for the next 20-30 years UK will be better facing it on its own, with the corresponding advantages and disadvantages. This statement of distrust from UK to rest of the EU introduces barriers and enhances distances in aspects of life that are far more important than some point of GDP  like sharing the same grounding values, culture, problems and vision of the future. European countries have , different languages, different governments , different religions and also different traditions. But they have the most important thing in common: THE FUTURE.The young generations are the future, theyâ€™ve grown and keep growing in a multicultural Europe that enjoys diversity, theyâ€™ve exchanged periods abroad with the Erasmus, theyâ€™ve made friends and connections in Europe, theyâ€™ve found love in Europe. Most, theyâ€™ve found themselves at ease in Europe sharing a common language English, sharing far  more similar habits than the elder people, sharing  similar goals and problems in life. The last generation of Europeans and next that will come are extremely  internationalized, theyâ€™re used to travel and work in Europe as if it was a unique large country. The trust of these young people in the other Europeans is far more deeply-rooted than a bunch of economic agreements, it is based on a sense of  membership and partnership in a common statement of values.The future is not going in the direction of isolation, everything is going to be more interconnected, more complex. The greatest challenges that we face are global, and being unite in front of them can only be positive.

As a somewhat neutral observer (yes, we are very fond of our neutrality) who has experienced both countries I really hope that you Britons take the once in a lifetime chance to leave. Donâ€™t be blinded and frightened by all the horror-scenarios that politicians are currently spreading. We had the same kind of politicians that back in 2001 told us that we would have no chance of surviving outside the EU, and that we would be lost without the EU and the Euro. By now even most pro-EU politicians have realised that we really dodged a bullet when the referendum was turned down (after all the parliament just recently voted to officially retract the letter that asked for talks to join the EU). While not all the Bilateral deals we have with the EU are great, they are still a million times better than actually joining the EU. Despite what some politicians might say, I strongly believe that Britain will be able to negotiate some kind of trade deals with the EU. After all, if little Switzerland which lies in the middle of the EU and which exports most of its goods to the EU, is capable of negotiating such a deal why wouldnâ€™t the UK?The worst thing for me about the EU is, however, its absolute incompatibility with democracy and in particular with our direct democracy. Every time we have a referendum or an initiative on matters concerning the EU and we donâ€™t vote in favour of what Brussels wants, we get threatened, bullied, and even insulted by the EU (for some reason the German MEPs are particularly active in all three things). The EU systematically tries to deny us the right to independently decide the fate of our country, as we have done it for the past 200 years.Just to sum things up: I can only advise every Briton to vote to leave tomorrow and finally take back control from an EU which will only become more undemocratic, more like a dictatorship, and continuously less economically attractive.

1623,1,Nobody_Anybody,"""Free trade cant exist unless everyone involved agrees"" That is just false. And I can show it by your own example.""For example if one country subsidies an industry it will be able to unfairly compete with the same industry in other countries."" So you do not allow for trading those items / services with that country or add an additional tax over it. If you can make your own rules you can also make this type of rules.You even come with this example yourself and say that is a trade war. Well then you have a trade war over that thing. Fact is you clearly disagree about something (that is why the 'trade-war' starts) and even with an EU you will still disagree over these things. If the EU does not allow Germany to subsidies their cars while the German population does want that (democracy) then the German people will get annoyed (and rightfully so). In fact these type of things are exactly why the EU has lost so much popularity.So the idea that these type of things would be solved with the EU is false. You still get disagreeing  countries.You simply have to accept those different ideas. You can accept that Germany subsidies their can industry and Germany has to accept that another country does add additional tax over subsidies cars to protect their own industry. You can name it a war, but it's not a problem. Not as big of a problem as countries bing forced into doing something they do not want to do (or never getting an agreement because they can't come to a mutual agreement).â€œCompanies aren't going to invest in foreign markets unless they have legally binding agreements in place to protect those investments.â€ They have been for many centuries with many countries. It is just a calculated risk they are willing to take. Sure they might prefer having those agreements, but it's not a requirement. Look at the Ukraine treaty. Many companies had investments in that country while there was no agreement with them. Sure those companies are in favor of the Ukraine treaty, but that does not mean they do not invest in those markets for as long as it does not exist.â€œThe idea trade or other decisions being made by mutual non binding agreements would be a disaster.â€ Complete utter nonsense. All the laws in your own country (that companies make use of as well) are basically non binding. Every 4 years you have the ability to pick another government that completely change those national regulations. That has never been a problem and so will also not be a problem when it's about agreements between countries.â€œThink about it for a moment. Your an american or chinese company looking to invest overseas whats more appealing. A unified europe with identicle regulations, curencies, and laws or a scattered mass of 28 states with 28 different rules and regulations.â€ I prefer to look what is more democratic in stead of what benefits some companies. A corporatism system is also better for companies (in fact the EU looks a lot like Corporatism) but I am still against it. Anyway, this scattered mass of 28 states have been trading with many other big countries like America an Chine for year, also before the (current) EU and Europe was a very rich continent. So it does not really matter. If we are 28 different countries with 28 different currencies they will still invest here if they think they can make money here.You know, we being all these separated countries is what in my opinion has made Europe so strong. It's not a weakness at all, that is something the Pro EU people want you to think.â€œour own companies or those in europe all benefit â€ Bigger companies do in fact benefit. I am not disputing that. But I find democracy and freedom more important and I know the companies will also just do fine without the EU. Just as they have done in the past.â€œIf you could clarify? â€Ah I see it says intensive instead of incentive. What I am saying is that even if the agreements are non-binding countries will still have good reasons to follow them. It's not that if the agreements are non-binding suddenly nobody is following them anymore as that would make them a untrustworthy party to work with.

I'll say my piece and shut my fat gun-loving GMO corn syrupy mouth:Leavers, know that the exact same volatile arguments presently being made by the Remainers were made against those who sought independence from Great Britain in the American colonies 240 years ago.  It is true that the newly born United States had no real plan after winning independence and our economy suffered as we stumbled along in the years immediately afterwards. We soon figured it out though.  Remainers, please beware that the movement for American independence did in fact set the stage for further revolution in the colonies of Great Britain and on continental Europe.  Thanks to Napoleon, it even turned into a blood bath.  You're right to worry that the exit of Great Britain could demolish the EU.Whichever way the vote goes, at least both sides can agree that it was done without bloodshed.  We hope.Personally, I would have liked to have seen the Leavers come up with some sort of a 'Common Sense' pamphlet and a Declaration of Independence to sway the vote past a 50/50 split, but I guess they'll take what they can get as long as they win.  It would have been lots more palatable if it were 70%+ in favor of Brexit than this photo finish 50/50 split you have now which sort of amounts to handcuffing yourself to an unwilling victim and jumping into the unknown.

It's a situation where everyone else, everywhere else can clearly see that the once great United Kingdom has been brought to its knees by Germany and a new Vichy France, yet the some on the isles have grown so used to captivity that they have come to prefer it. Even if they could easily get a much better deal outside of their current arrangement, the predictability of it suits them and they don't like change. It's what we call Stockholm Syndrome. This is commonly exhibited by beaten wives. When asked why their eye is bruised they'll say, ""I tripped down the stairs"", or ""it was my fault"", making any excuse possible for their abuser out of some misplaced sense of loyalty, always inspired by fear.

Germany is currently 1st place paying for EU and the UK is on second place, meaning if the UK leaves, Germany will either have to pay more, so the taxes will raise, or they will spend less on like public swimming pools or schools.  We will lose a big trading partner. Our products will cost more in the UK, because of the toll (is that the name for it? Or is it customs?). Meaning the UK will buy less products from us, we will sell less, produce less and therefore lose money.  Working in the UK will be a no way situation.

First, we have to fight the idea of ""free trade"" and destroy the institutions that are built around it (i.e., the EU, NAFTA...), and which support it.  Once the constant threat of producers taking their ball and going elsewhere (i.e., taking manufacturing to the developing world) without fear of being slapped with massive tariffs when they try to sell their goods back at ""home"", and we remove the option of simply employing immigrants (especially illegals in the U. S.) at half the cost of natural born citizens, then we can start addressing the larger issues of tax fairness, wealth distribution, and so on.The independent seems to be taking a position that lacks strategy.

If you're just looking for what the markets are saying, the general rule is higher GBP = more confidence in Remain winning while lower GBP = more confidence in Brexit winning. Going back to the graph, if you zoom in your tick size to 1 minute, you can see the trades that are being executed on a minute by minute basis. These fluctuations are huge. You can see parts where the graph changes by up to 0.5 cents in 5 minutes. While this may not seem like much, positions in FX are typically levered between 50:1 to 200:1. If you assume you have a position levered 100:1, a 1.5 cent increase will roughly double your initial investment while a 1.5 cent decrease will wipe you down to 0. (This of course varies based on the price of the currency but if you had bought into GBP at 3 PM last night, it went up roughly 2 cents overnight and a $1000 position at 100:1 levered would've net you over $1300 profit) ",NA,NA,4pgpmw,0.000108809,-0.999782382,Against,23-06-16

There are unproven rumours around his prior political beliefs and behaviours that also taint his reputation.His rhetoric is variably interpreted as brutally honest or somewhat racist by different people and it's this divide along with his propensity to focus on sensitive issues that makes him a controversial figure.There is much more to say but I do not know how to clearly articulate it without risking my own bias coming in.But in short, toad-faced cretin.",d4ln0vi,d4lm8sj,4pk1zz,0.010564253,-0.978871494,Against,24-06-16

He also complained in an interview that he had to ride a train most of the way across London before he heard English being spoken - something i'd counter with the fact my gf speaks French and when we're over there, she and her friends speak English despite being fully integrated there.He falsely claimed that the NHS was overloaded with TB being brought over by eastern europeans and when asked about fears of a large number of Romanians migrating here he said ""You wouldnt want a bunch moving in next door""He has also made claims such as women with kids being worth less than men to the financial sector and the Syrian refugees being full of extremists and ISIS members in disguise.He has also been caught out in tax avoidance and undeclared gift issues and pocketed over Â£2million in an EU expenses scam when we had that whole issue over here a few years ago with loads of politicians domestically.I find his rhetoric to be pure scaremongering never backed up by any solid and considered plan. To me he plays on people's fears and insecurities to drum up images of all hell to be loosed upon us if we do retract to being a completely self-serving nation.

It is a question of **how do you define the worth of a person** and what all derives from this definition. This is a deep anthropological &amp; philosophical issue.The discussion is being held in nearly every western society at this time (also you guys on the other side of the atlantic do it right now):  The questions being asked differ depending on the time and society which asks them (e.g.: want wall / no immigrants / no supra national governmental body / stengthen your state or national POV / want free personal travel / separation of power / transfer money to other states / Jefferson vs Hamilton / ...) but they all just carve on different layers of the very same big question:*Do we want to walk on a more authoritarian path or walk on a more liberal path into our future?*The answers to this question differ wildly, based on if you tend to see people as  - individual beings (IB), defined more by having the very same basic rights than where they come from    - social beings (SB), defined more by having the same background than some abstract rights  The SB value the heritage of a person quite high. They want to strengthen these social backgrounds, some have a strong conservative approach to repower national, local and family structures. Some have a strong neoliberal approach to deregulate super national regulations. Other bring arguments that I do not want to foster here.The IB want to base the value of people not on their heritage but more on abstract individual rights, which shall be the very same for everyone. All of the western nations struggle to keep that promise. This approach was abused by neoliberals in the last few decades to undermine these abstract individual rights it is based on and to weaken the governmental bodies which are in responsibilty (since Rousseau) to grant these rights.In swiss television they covered this topic quite well, sadly I could not find a translated/subtitled version.

2534,1,CornerMirror,"The definition you use for the word ""populism"" is the one that best supports what you were saying in your previous post. If only using this definition then yes, it does apply to the brexit campaign.Unfortunately the term ""populism"" has a large number of definitions and their differences can shift its meaning in significant ways. For example, the Collins dictionnary gives this definition for the word ""populism"": ""a political strategy based on a calculated appeal to the interests or prejudices of ordinary people"".Now, ""appealing to the interests or prejudices of ordinary people"" is just a way of describing politics. Which is the point that I was trying to make: according to this definition, every politician, from every side, is a populist. I guess the bottom line is that the word ""Populism"" is a bad word because it has too many definitions that even if they are not contradicting each other, are still significantly different. So, in my opinion, the term is not sufficiently precise. When it comes to the left and the right argument, I disagree. I think your impression that those notions are outdated come from the fact that for a long time, the left had won the ideological battle in Europe and that both left-wing and right-wing parties had become increasingly similar. That is to say that right-wing parties had increasingly started leaning to the left.So, I think you are right in saying that the left/right opposition is not really accurate nowadays. However, as the Brexit vote shows (and it was close: almost 50/50), there IS a major division between what used to be considered the ""far-right"", traditionnally  the ugly duckling of politics in Europe and the political establishment (both traditionnal right-wing and left-wing parties). But you are correct, left vs right, far-right/ political establishment is not really precise. I think a better way of framing it is globalists vs sovereignists or nationalists. Regarding your argument on the ""quality level"" of the political debate, I really don't know... I think it's always been THAT bad. I think it probably always will be. An intellectual debate on youtube gathers what? 200 000 views at the very best? A cat-that-farts video brings ten times that. A guy who plays video games on youtube brings millions if not trillions of views. For lack of time or simply not being used to seeking knowledge, the majority of people doesn't try to get the best information they could. However, if anything, technology does give the people who genuinely want to learn more an opportunity to do so... You might be older than me and remember a better time but all my life I have been appalled by the level of the political debate...It comes down to a philosophical question really. We all take decisions based on incomplete information. We don't know everything and yet we still have to act. So how much information is enough information? I don't have an anwser for that really. I think common sense generally takes you where you wanna go. I'm just not sure ""common sense"" is all that ""common""...

This is about far more than just economics:It is a question of **how do you define the worth of a person** and what all derives from this definition. This is a deep anthropological &amp; philosophical issue.The discussion is being held in nearly every western society at this time (also you guys on the other side of the atlantic do it right now):  The questions being asked differ depending on the time and society which asks them (e.g.: want wall / no immigrants / no supra national governmental body / stengthen your state or national POV / want free personal travel / separation of power / transfer money to other states / Jefferson vs Hamilton / ...) but they all just carve on different layers of the very same big question:*Do we want to walk on a more authoritarian path or walk on a more liberal path into our future?*The answers to this question differ wildly, based on if you tend to see people as  - individual beings (IB), defined more by having the very same basic rights than where they come from    - social beings (SB), defined more by having the same background than some abstract rights  The SB value the heritage of a person quite high. They want to strengthen these social backgrounds, some have a strong conservative approach to repower national, local and family structures. Some have a strong neoliberal approach to deregulate super national regulations. Other bring arguments that I do not want to foster here.The IB want to base the value of people not on their heritage but more on abstract individual rights, which shall be the very same for everyone. All of the western nations struggle to keep that promise. This approach was abused by neoliberals in the last few decades to undermine these abstract individual rights it is based on and to weaken the governmental bodies which are in responsibilty (since Rousseau) to grant these rights.In swiss television they covered this topic quite well, sadly I could not find a translated/subtitled version.

After they joined up for the predecessor of EU, they got economically very much better. I am not directly involved in politics, but this development is most entertaining. An entire country voting out of something that can be regarded as the biggest project for peace and prosperity is one of the most important decisions to be made in my life time. To consider is that, in order to get access to European markets, just like Norway or Switzerland, they would have to pay a tariff similar to the  amount they payed to the EU before; the fact that Scotland and Gibraltar as well as North Ireland may choose to separate themselves from England or that the british nuclear weapons are currently based in Scotland, thus endangering the UK(if it can be called that still in 2 years) seat in the UN Security Council. I think that, whatever happens to the EU afterwards, wether France, Italy or Hungary will have their -xit, Great Britain looses. True, the EU is, at the moment, still very much not democratic enough and a bureaucratic monster, but leaving wont solve the problem, as, for example, Britain would still have to produce trade goods according to their regulations in order for them to be bought, without having a say in those regulations. But you know, fuck it all. I was born in Germany. I am not proud of that fact; it is surely no achievement to take pride in.

The average IQ of a degree holder will be much higher than that of a GCSE or less person. Ofcourse there may be some genius with only GCSE's and an upper class retard that got tutored through Uni, but the averages still stand.If I was in Australia I would just do the thing I thought would make me the most money and that I could accomplish. In the UK, it does make you smarter, because trades aren't as lucrative, and if you pass your GCSE's you do A levels, because your average wage increases by about Â£10,000. And if you do a degree you get another Â£7000 on top. And that is for miscellaneous degrees like art and history. Doing a real one is a much bigger salary boost obviously.

2817,1,CornerMirror,"First of all, I never said there was no difference bewteen being a Muslim and being a terrorist. What I said was that Islam discriminates against other religions, mainly judaism and christianity. Islam recognizes those religions, it even acknowledges the existence of Jesus Christ but it also states that it is the final religion revelead and that, therefore, it replaces the religions that came before it. Islam wages djihad on its ennemies: atheists, apostates, jews, homosexuals but also any group that is deemed ""hostile"" to Islam. It also promises paradise for those who die fighting the djihad. I didn't say that every muslims practices those aspects of Islam. But if they don't, it is either because they don't know their own religion very well or because they are too lazy to follow djihad. To answer your other question, I can also see the difference between a white supremacist and a Christian. However, that doesn't mean that Christians cannot be white supremacists. Now, if muslims really want to distance themselves from bigotry and violence, I would suggest that they stop adoring a ""prophet"" who waged war, killed people, took slaves and married a child. I would also suggest that they look for actual hard evidence that the Quran is the actual word of god that was spoken to Muhammad through the archangel Gabriel. The problem is they're not gonna find any actual proof of all that bullshit and guess what: irrational people will keep not acting rationally.

2818,1,Nobody_Anybody,"I notices how age made a big difference in the UK but that is not true everywhere. Also your correlation with Sweden is a little strange.. What you want to say? That a bunch of people died and now they are in favor.You also say the old people look back and blame all negative things on the EU. Well imho a lot of negative things are in fact because of the EU, but that to the side. I find it a cheap blame towards one groupâ€¦ I could also do the same cheap trick towards the young. They donâ€™t know any better than the EU, and are afraid for what is new.Of course both are bad blame games that do not get to the true reason.Personally I simply think that many of the youth that does not really researches the subject, simply beliefs the story that the EU is â€œworking togetherâ€, is â€œbeing friendsâ€, is â€œgoing on vacation without a visaâ€ and so on. That is how the EU has always been promoted. Itâ€™s why many politicians always talk about Europe when they are in fact talking about the EU. They want people to give that idea.Now those older people donâ€™t fall for that story because they know you can have similar things without being the EU. They compare the EU form now with the EEC and then decide that they prefer something like the EEC.Countries can still work together and make agreements to let members of their counties freely commute across the borders. There is no EU needed for that. The difference between that and the EU, is that the EU also tells you not to use light bulbs, 1600W vacuum cleaners, not allowing you to give plastic bags away for free, not allowing you to make your own agreement with India, dividing your money based on what they think is good and so on.I think that a lot of the people who voted IN now, will say â€œIt was not as bad as we expectedâ€ 6 years from now.",d4m7tif,d4m5w81,4plnlr,0.741362036,0.482724072,Brexit,24-06-16

2838,1,CornerMirror,"First of all, who are you to say that people who practice Taqiya do not sincerely fear persecution for their beliefs? As far as I can tell, there is no collective islamic tribunal that decides wether or not a muslim is allowed to practice Taqiya given a certain context. It's all up to the individual to determine whether or not he feels he needs to be practicing Taqiya. Surely being in a non-Islamic land can grant credence to their fear of persecution. I don't understand what you mean when you say that the Taqiya argument is full of holes. On the contrary. Religiously it is fullproof, all a muslim has to say was that he feared persecution (can we blame people for being afraid?) and legally it s not that it has holes, it s just that it doesn't exist. Thank god german law doesn't recognize the coranic law yet. So, sorry but the taqiya argument still stands. Now to your other points. Drunk people do dumb and illegal shit. Granted. But if you find ANY evidence of MASS sexual agression by LARGE groups of people in Germany post russian rapes sprees in WWII, I demand to see this evidence. Alcohol and group dynamics do not exclude the islamic character of those attacks. You are right to say that religion is not so much a deciding aspect of our culture in Europe (thank goodness for that) anymore. That is because Christianity has been reformed (see Vatican II) and Judaism has been forced into strict legal parameters (at least that's the situation I know of in France). Islam has never been reformed or modernized. Furthermore it's very possible that Islam is also a more agressive ideology than Christianity (Jesus and Muhammad, two very different kinds of fellows). Now, after all that is said: if you want to deny any ""islamic"" character to the constant terrorist attemps against the west be my guest. 9/11? nooo, it was american imperialism. Madrid? no, they just didn't like fajitas. London? they were environmentalists who thought public buses released too much polution. Charlie Hedbo? They were right, you should never make fun of another religion. Mohammed Merah? He was a sweetheart, his gun went off by accident.The Thalys incident where hundreds could have died? He was just trying to rob people.13 november in Paris? Nooo, they were just ghetto kids who wanted a better future. Brussels? The smell of french fries was too much, they couldn't handle it. Orlando? he was gay and didn't like gays, that's allI'll let you fill the gaps for the next, inevitable bloodbaths.

2889,1,andrew815,"The UK hasn't lost any real money at the moment, the markets crashed but that is expected of course. The fundamentals have not changed this much overnight, it's just panic due to the uncertainty. Standard market panicking combined with big players exploiting the fear for huge profits. There will obviously be a hit at first as we renegotiate everything over the years, but once that's all settled it will be business as usual with the added bonuses of no imposed laws from Brussels and more common sense flexible border controls.Instruments all around the world are highly undervalued now. I'm not saying this is the absolute low, since there are usually second or third dips during market 'crashes' designed to trick bottom-fishing traders and scare the rest into offloading their holdings, but the markets will recover. I wouldn't be surprised if even 1 year from now the FTSE was back where it was before this crash.Nothing need really change, we are still in the NATO alliance, there are guaranteed to be trade deals due to it being in foreign big business interests, we can still go on holiday in Europe, we will still co operate diplomatically to solve global issues, we can now deny suspected terror suspects from entering the country and deport unsavoury terrorist sympathisers. We can let in 1 Trillion migrants a week if we want, it doesn't have to go down, the point is that we now have some flexible control to adapt to the circumstances and needs of the time.I saw a tweet saying we destroyed the biggest peace project in the world, dramatic eh. Peace is not affected at all since we are still in NATO, we are all on friendly terms anyway and it's ludicrous to think any country in Europe would fight another. Also the talk of us become isolatoinist and shutting ourselves off is ridiculous, I think people will be shocked at just how little actually changes.The EU needed to be a simple trade agreement and co-operation alliance (share academic research/resources, intelligence, extradition laws etc), Brussels pushed too far by being able to undemocratically force laws onto us that we did not vote for and are not written to suit our country's specific needs. You can't impose laws across Europe in a one size fits all manner, the various economies are too different and of vastly varying sizes. The whole forced lawmaker thing is just ridiculous and unnecessary really, it's just power hungry euro leaders wanting to impose their will. Also many of the laws and 'independent' reports/studies that lead to laws, are created or lobbied for by big businesses behind the scenes who are only interested in increasing their profits, the system as it exists at the moment in the EU is simply too corrupt and undemocratic.The stubborn arrogance of Junker did not help either, refusing to significantly alter the free movement laws which are set up like the wild west without limits or controls. You absolutely cannot allow yourself to be forced into accepting people into the country who are on your terrorist watch list, there's no defence of that. The 'deal' that Cameron got was awful and nothing much changed, Junker just played bully boy and refused to offer reasonable common sense compromise - simply because he did not have to. Even if Junker did compromise though I would still prefer out due to the undemocratic forced imposition of laws via Brussels.In this era The EU just needs to be about trade + the other co-operation areas I mentioned. Nothing more is needed. The world is not ready for a futuristic and idealistic 'global government' where the idea of individual sovereign countries are a thing of the past. The EU just tried to rush all this integration too fast, and the cracks are now showing across Europe where EU support is near 50-50 in many of the big member states. This whole utopian idea will take many hundreds of years before it can even possibly come to fruition and the planet is united as one under a global government. Remember it's only in the last 100~ years that we have had 2 primitive world wars, the world scene has not evolved enough yet for the 'sovereignty eroding' style of the current EU to be workable.Anyway, once the trade deals are back in place I expect it to be pretty much business as usual for the UK. I regret that Gibraltar is now probably going to be shafted and bullied by Spain, and we will lose Scotland, but the best decision is rarely the easy and painless option. With the cracks now showing across Europe for EU support I hope EU leaders will start to reign in the integration measures to avoid the whole initiative imploding. Not that it really matters much for the UK now (except more market crashes if the EU ever did dissolve - read 'buy opportunity') but at this point it may be better to just tear it down and rebuild the whole thing from scratch, learn from the mistakes and use the opportunity to streamline and cut out any bureaucracy bloat that has developed over the decades.",d4mc1ye,4pmgzg,4pmgzg,1,1,Brexit,24-06-16

2936,1,RAndrewOhge,"Brexit And Goals and Ops of the Deep StateBy Jon Rappoport - Jun 24, 2016We have to start with Brexit, which scored a victory last night. Britain leaves the EU. Bang. Other European countries are ready to put the same referendum up for vote. And George Soros is making money from having invested in gold earlier in the month. Naturally. The vulture never sleeps.Speaking of money making money, the â€œhysterical aftershocksâ€ in trading markets, right after the Brexit victory was projected, are all synthetic and artificial manipulations, laid on to prove a point: see what happens when a country defects from the New Order? Meanwhile, the people who had real jobs yesterday still have them today. Life goes on. Britain will still be able to engage in trade with other countries, despite Obamaâ€™s warning that theyâ€™ll have to stand in the back of the line to make deals with the US. Nonsense. Blather. Obama is failing in his job as front man for Rockefeller Globalists. If he canâ€™t get Senate ratification on the TPP and the TTIP deals now, heâ€™ll be the CFRâ€™s failure of the decade. Hillary, who came out against Brexit, is looking like a clown with egg on her face.Soâ€¦what is Britain leaving when it leaves the EU? Itâ€™s departing a giant robot, a structure of untold numbers of sub-androids, bureaucrats who have been making life miserable for Europe. Higher debt, unlimited migration, blizzards of regulations, grim political correctness. All in the service of a coming utopia, of course.The real job of the EU is dehumanizing people, for the sake of humanity. Thatâ€™s how faceless robot-bureaucrats operate.The EU is an illusion of authority, in the sense that it pretends to be in exclusive possession of knowledge that will make life better for all of Europe.The EU built itself as a machine, a structure so maze-like, so complex that â€œit must be valuable.â€ It resembles a super-computer. â€œWe have trillions of pieces of vital data. We can plan the future more competently than any smaller entity. Leave the details to us.â€The EU is in all these ways a copy of the Deep Global State, of which it is a part. And now we come to the second section of this article, which I wrote first, as I was becoming aware of the result of the Brexit vote. Consider it background. The Deep State has, of course, not gone away. A much greater degree of dismantling is necessary. Technocracy itself has to be understood and defeated, because it is the leading edge of the new Globalist societyâ€¦The State is now involved in making people into robots and robots into people.Behind all the technological promises and heraldry, this is whatâ€™s happening. People are already beginning to feel a fierce unshakable loyalty to machinesâ€”and a religious adoration. Up the road, robots will be wise counselors and guides and priests. This is civilizationâ€™s version of magic.Technocracy and theocracy are the same op. They are rule by fictional figures. And the knowledge supposedly possessed by these figures doesnâ€™t exist.Whether a person or a machine can dispense three pieces of information or three trillion, and whether the dispensing takes a year or a microsecond, the â€œauthorityâ€ surrounding the dispensing is window dressing. It doesnâ€™t have any inherent power. Itâ€™s laid on in the same way a movie set is built (or a green screen is deployed) to confer authenticity.The following two statements are remarkably similar: the Pope is infallible; super-computer XYZ is infallible. The latter statement is a modern substitution for the former. It wouldnâ€™t be a great surprise, at some point, to witness the election of a Pope that is a computer. The College of Cardinals might discuss whether to present him as a robot wearing the official costume of office. They might even decide this robot should ride in the Bubble Mobile with its protections, to avoid damage. Vatican technicians would assure the Pope uttered, from time to time, humanitarian messages in a credibly human voice.On the other side of the op, as humans are fitted into tighter slots in the New Planetary Order, they would, more and more, resemble machines in thought and action. Losing their individuality, through sacrifice for the greater good, they would naturally seek out signs and signals of what they no longer hadâ€”and they would find those human traits in robot-computers, which would be built with great care to deliver an imitation of life.Sit a very young child down in front of a crude robot called a television set, and show her an animated cartoon of Cinderella dancing in the hall of a great palace, and the child experiences trance-like ecstasy. Why, up the road, wouldnâ€™t a sufficiently â€œmechanizedâ€ adult find the same joy, viewing an animated hologram of a remarkably convincing robot that hands out ideological imperatives on the oneness of all creatures on Earth?â€”On the subject of taking individuality from humans and placing it into robots:â€œEvery one of our androids is different. Our company believes in imbuing each of our â€˜messengersâ€™ with a unique set of characteristics. This isnâ€™t a sales technique. Weâ€™re dedicated to the mission of diversity. Personality isnâ€™t something to be buried under a surface of sameness and conformity. It should be front and center. After all, our robots are conscious.â€They arenâ€™t, but who pauses to notice? Wave after wave of fictional propaganda is launched to make the case that machines are alive. The major target of the campaign is the educated class.â€œIt is now an established fact that evolution took place through higher and higher orders of information-processing functions. Indeed, the complexity of processing is the definition of consciousness.â€ Gibberish.In this technological and pragmatic civilization, many humans already consider themselves, first and foremost, problem solvers. However, recognizing their skills are lacking, especially when it comes to personal issues, people are more than willing to surrender the job to machines. Computers will provide undeniable answers and advice. Of course, to make this system work, the problems and the people will have to be reduced down to manageable proportionsâ€”flattened, short-circuited, cartoon-ized. People will need to see themselves as biological machines with only a handful of basic needs. And some historian will one day write:â€œHumans were operating on flawed self-destructive programs. The best of them realized this. And so, out of need and desperation, they invented machines that could guide them and work around those errors. This was the patch that was laid on, until we could precisely identify both the programs and the flaws, flush them out of the system, and install new software in the brain.â€This is the future.Unless individuals, with the power they actually do have, reclaim what is theirs, and dump the whole ridiculous apparatus.The EUâ€”that machineâ€”is one small part of the whole op.It is a machine, whose purpose is turning humans into robots and robots into humans.Thatâ€™s the bottom line of highly centralized authority in the modern age.Coda: warning: the BBC is reporting that the British Parliament must ratify the referendum result. And the UK withdrawal from the EU will take place â€œwithin two years.â€ Itâ€™s a withdrawal negotiated between the British government and the EU. So various conditions and side-deals could be slipped into the equation.https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2016/06/24/brexit-and-goals-and-ops-of-the-deep-state/",d4mg7st,4pnxz5,4pnxz5,0.742888969,0.485777939,Brexit,24-06-16

3054,1,RAndrewOhge,"Brexit = Death of the TechnocratsMichael Krieger | Jun 24, 2016My political opinions lean more and more to Anarchy (philosophically understood, meaning abolition of control not whiskered men with bombs) â€¦ the most improper job of any man, even saints (who at any rate were at least unwilling to take it on), is bossing other men. Not one in a million is fit for it, and least of all those who seek the opportunity.â€“ J. R. R. TolkienWhat transpired last night in the United Kingdom represented one of the most extraordinarily expressions of democracy of my lifetime. When faced with an event of such monumental significance, itâ€™s difficult to pick any particular direction for a post like this. I have so many thoughts running through my mind and so many angles I could potentially address, it is simply impossible to do them all justice. As such, Iâ€™ve decided to focus on one very meaningful implication of Brexit: death of the technocrats.To start, I want to dive into one of the more interesting controversies from the weeks leading up to the vote. What Iâ€™m referring to is the statement made by Vote Leaveâ€™s Michael Grove regarding â€œexperts.â€From the Telegraph(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/06/eu-referendum-who-needs-experts-when-weve-got-michael-gove/):On Friday night, during an interview on Sky News about the EU, Faisal Islam challenged the Justice Secretary to name a single independent economic authority that thought Brexit was a good idea. Mr Goveâ€™s response was defiant.[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/03/how-did-michael-gove-cope-with-the-sky-news-audience-and-faisal/]â€œIâ€™m glad these organizations arenâ€™t on my side,â€ he said. â€œI think people in this country have had enough of experts.â€Mr Islam spluttered incredulously. People in this country, he repeated, â€œhave had enough of experts?â€Mr Gove stood his ground. Yes, he said, people in this country had had enough of experts â€œsaying that they know what is bestâ€. Mr Gove had â€œfaith in the British peopleâ€. The so-called experts, clearly, did not.For his words, Mr. Gove was attacked relentlessly. He was lectured about his dangerous language and scolded for its supposed anti-intellectualism. The â€œvery smart peopleâ€ issuing these condemnations did so in their typical self-satisfied, smug manner. Nonetheless, Michael Gove was absolutely correct in his assessment, and in this post I will detail precisely why.First of all, what is an â€œexpert?â€ From what I can gather this term is bestows upon someone with an advanced degree who has successfully maneuvered him or herself into a position of prominence within government, a think tank or academia.As someone who worked on Wall Street for a decade, I was constantly surrounded by people with advanced degrees from the most prestigious institutions. I also know that your degree means absolutely nothing the moment you walk in that door for the first day of work. You enter a place filled with people who have battling it out for years if not decades in their profession of choice, and the only thing that matters now is performance. If you donâ€™t perform youâ€™re gone, and nobodyâ€™s gonna care about the long string of letters next to your name.The world of politics, government and central banking famously and problematically does not work this way. Look around you at all the discredited â€œthought leadersâ€ who continue to be paraded around on television, and who still advise Presidents and Prime Ministers the world over. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis no changing of the guard was permitted. Sure we were given a fresh face with Barack Obama, but his advisers didnâ€™t change. He immediately hired both Larry Summers and Timothy Geithner, and thatâ€™s the moment I knew he was a gigantic fraud. To summarize, the exact same people who ruined the world bailed themselves out, avoided all accountability and continue to call the shots. These are the men and women we know as â€œthe experts.â€The point isnâ€™t to say that having an advanced degree in a particular field of study doesnâ€™t make an individual especially useful to society. It does. The issue here is accountability. If you want to go around calling yourself an expert and demanding that your views be implemented across a given civilization, you had better do a good job. If you do a poor job, you should be immediately replaced with someone who has a different perspective. After all, there are plenty of experts out there to choose from. Unfortunately, our societies tend to get stuck with egomaniacal, incompetent, but politically savvy experts who never go away. They can blow up the world a million times over and still somehow survive to call the shots. This is the main reason the world is in the state itâ€™s in, and itâ€™s the reason reactionary forces are rising across the globe.The Brexit vote in itself proves the point. Sure, David Cameron has announced his intention to resign, but where are the the resignations of EU technocrats? If anyone was discredited by this vote itâ€™s the leadership of the EU, but they arenâ€™t going anywhere. Why? Because theyâ€™re experts, and experts stay around forever. Like Larry Summers, bank executives and neocon war mongers, these people never suffer the consequences of their actions and thus remain free to run around endlessly destroying the world from their unassailable perches of power.Thatâ€™s the point. Being an expert does not make you infallible. Your credentials should certainly offer you a seat at the policy making table, but from that moment on you had better demonstrate performance. Itâ€™s the same way with a corporate job. The resume gets you in the door, but your production day in and day out keeps you in the seat.The status quo doesnâ€™t see things this way. To the status quo technocrat, this is a lifelong position. They consider themselves to be the wise indispensable elders required to steer the world in the right direction irrespective of any and all calamities they cause along the way. Unfortunately for us, history shows us that the biggest disasters happen precisely when you combine such expert arrogance with unbridled power.One of the best modern examples of this relates to the tale of the 1990â€™s mega hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM). A story that was perfectly captured in the excellent book by Roger Lowenstein, When Genius Failed.(https://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-Long-Term-Management/dp/0375758259)The leadership of LTCM was hailed as the best of the best from the beginning and expectations were high. Itâ€™s principals consisted of not only Wall Street veterans but also several former university professors, including two Nobel Prize-winning economists. Yet, what transpired after only five years in operation was one of the most spectacular failures of modern times. A train wreck so large and so completely out of control, it required a Federal Reserve led bailout.What happened with LTCM is happening right now across the political and economic spheres in virtually all nations. You have a collection of self-assured, arrogant â€œexpertsâ€ running the world into the ground with their policies. As I said earlier, I have no problem with experts. I have a problem when experts are permitted to operate with zero accountability. The EU represents such technocratic immunity better than any other in the Western world. The British people recognized that they couldnâ€™t remove these technocrats from power from within (something proven once and for all by the fact no EU leaders have resigned), so they decided to leave. I commend that choice and I think the sooner the status quo is disposed of, the greater the likelihood for a positive long-term outcome.As I warned last year in my post, A Message to Europe â€“ Prepare for Nationalism(https://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2015/11/14/a-message-to-europe-prepare-for-nationalism/):Actions have consequences, and people can only be pushed so far before they snap. I believe the Paris terror attacks will be a major catalyst that will ultimately usher in nationalist type governments in many parts of Europe, culminating in an end of the EU as we know it and a return to true nation-states. Although I think a return to regional government and democracy is what Europeans need and deserve, the way in which it will come about, and the types of governments we could see emerge, are unlikely to be particularly enlightened or democratic after the dust has settled.My thoughts and prayers go out to all the victims of these horrific events, but the Paris attacks didnâ€™t happen in a vacuum. The people of Europe have already become increasingly resentful against the EU,  something which is not debatable at this point. This accurate perception of an undemocratic, technocratic Brussels-led EU dictatorship was further solidified earlier this year after the Greek people went to the polls and voted for one thing, only to be instructed that their vote doesnâ€™t actually matter.Actions have consequences, and weâ€™ve now witnessed the first of these consequences. The â€œexpertsâ€ have warned us of the disaster to befall Great Britain should it Brexit. Well we now have front row seats from which to observe the outcome of the UK versus large economies that remain in the euro such as France, Spain and Italy in the years ahead. As usual, I suspect the experts will be wrong.More: http://libertyblitzkrieg.com/2016/06/24/brexit-death-of-the-technocrats/",d4mn81s,4por83,4por83,0.994373769,0.988747538,Brexit,24-06-16

Does anyone actually realise how fucked the UK is outside of the EU?This morning, we managed to lose Â£300 Billion just because of this. Congrats to everyone who thinks this a great idea. Share prices for almost every company in the UK has plummeted. The pound has reached an all time low for 31 years. It looked like the only people in the UK that wanted to stay in the EU were the Scottish and Londoners. Apparently these are the only people that have a single brain cell. In 2008 we had the recession, the UK went into a pandemic. Today, we decide that we will be leaving the EU. We have exactly the same consequences as 2008, but don't worry guys!, We're not allowing those pesky immigrants into the country that will most likely be 110% smarter than anyone who actually voted leave.

3344,1,krfr,"Brexit - Why I voted... The results have come as a shock and the reaction has been interesting to say the least. I'll tell you how I voted further on but first I want you to read my reasons without bias.Personally I am a huge supporter of freedom of movement, trade and financial/personal equality but enough about me here's what I think.For me the result of this referendum is the consequence of the last 30/40 years of British politics that have caused deep divisions in the country. Firstly having freedom of movement and trade across 500 million whilst still encouraging an economic/financial system that causes massive inequality is stupid you simply increase inequality due to the increased amount of wealth available to accumulate For example if you have 99% of a pie and the pie is suddenly bigger you now have a lot more pie. It is genuinely not a good idea. I know this is hard for me to get across to people that I support free movement but not the way it's been handled so excuse me for a bad attempt.Secondly, the entire culture of the country has changed. Social media has fundamentally altered the way that we interact. Here I am sat typing a post to reddit that can be read all over the world while during the last EU referendum in 75 the only people who would hear my thoughts would be those bothered to sit and listen. While this is great it also runs the risk of group think where people agree with things because the group does without really spending the time to think about it in the bigger picture. For example if you say something someone doesn't agree with on Twitter you could be harassed for weeks whereas if I'm talking one on one about politics if we disagree we discuss both sides not just hurl meme's at each other and abuse.The leave people think they are being ignored and talked down to while the remain think they are fighting racists but because the two sides are too busy arguing with each other to ever bother to address the fundamental problem behind the issues.The media and politicians have then taken these genuine concerns raised by certain demographics about the way the country is working and spun it to about people ""stealing jobs"" ""us against them"" etc now people are voicing the right concerns but aimed at entirely the wrong cause. Thirdly, this had been brewing for many years but we could afford it. Then the plug was pulled in 2008 and then we couldn't afford it so they had to cut. More people (net immigration) but worsening services has been a recipe for disaster and the scapegoat became the EU. The cost of these low wages/unemployment/underemployment and over supply of labour has been increased debt, stress and for many financial ruin, just look at food bank usage.I believe in a Europe (and the rest of the world obviously) where people are valued more than money, where the outcome of your life is not decided by the luck of the draw of where your born and where the work you do is equal to the reward. Seeing as the EU follows the same neo-liberal financial system as the UK then I don't believe the EU is capable of creating a Europe that I believe in. So I voted out, I shot myself in the foot to one day achieve a political dream that will never exist.I fully understand why people voted to stay in. The headline benefits are great but with knowledge of the banking/financial system you'll see it is a square peg in a round hole. Socialist policies yet still designed to enrich the few.
