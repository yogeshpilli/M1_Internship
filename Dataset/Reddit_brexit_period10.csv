113559,10,Hrimnir,"So i don't necessarily disagree with your statement, but unfortunately that's not how it was handled, and there was plenty of opportunity for the UK government to propose that route.  Fortunately or unfortunately David Cameron chose to put it up as a general vote, the people voted, and the results were clear.Trying to move the goalposts after the fact is 100% against the system that was set up.  The rules are set up and everyone should play by the rules.I'll give examples in the US.  There are many contentious things that large swathes of the country disagree with.  The framers of the constitution put in methods for changing things in the constitution, the amendment process.  They anticipated and wanted to combat the fleeting winds of social change.  There are many things that become ""huge"" issues for a couple years and then everyone stops caring.  That's why they made it take a 2/3 majority to amend the constitution.So, what happens is you have these groups that hate things, let's pick on the 2nd Amendment for a moment, and they know that they can't get a 2/3 majority vote, so they constantly move the goalposts, try to legislate from the bench, try to do mental gymnastics to interpret laws in a certain special way.They constantly get smacked down by the supreme court but that doesn't keep them from trying.At the end of the day im an outsider, im not a UK citizen so my 2 cents is just that.  That being said a lot of what is happening on the more ""left"" political spectrum in that country smacks greatly of the kind of bullshit that people try to pull here in the US.Now, i want to stress that im not saying this is solely the left that engages in this (it has just been more so the case in recent years), there are plenty examples of right wingers doing precisely the same thing, and i will chide it when they do it to.",e9sc4um,e9ry5xq,9xbr4j,0.932248975,0.86449795,Brexit,16-11-18

113564,10,Carmonred,"I keep disagreeing. If I'm offered a choice it should be in my interest to make an informed decision lest I run the risk of deciding to my detriment. The BBC ran an interesting article to that effect a couple months back, about former coal miners in the USA who voted for Trump. Who didn't bring their jobs back and was in the process of dismantling the healthcare package that paid for the treatment of their mining-related ailments.Now granted, the con men manipulating public perception have their own crosses and should have been forced to bear them. It's a shame Johnson didn't get the job so he could be receiving all the flak May's been getting. Farage at least had the smarts to see that his bluff had been called and get the hell out of the kitchen but karma seems to have gotten to him anyway.Is it a multi-layered problem? Yes, but IMO not moreso than with any other election. It's one of those shortfalls of democracy. Either you allow everyone to vote, even people who will infallibly fall for the outright lies of con men or you're not a western style democracy anymore at all.I mean, I'd love if there was a way to ensure people really got a reasonably subjective presentation of their options in a case such as this.

113566,10,Carmonred,"To be fair, as is being said a lot of other places, you just can't repeat a vote until you get the result you like. IMO it's people's responsibility to understand what they're voting for. Sure, there could have been better information campaigns one way or another but apparently the political establishment either had no faith in the EU or too much faith in the voters.(My line of thought has always been that Johnson and Farage also never expected the vote to go through, which would have allowed them to keep sniping from the sidelines and belabour the 'missed opportunity to set things right' or so. Which is why Farage immediately turned and ran.)Anyway. The EU was never going to make this easy on the UK since the Brexit will set the precedent for a country leaving the EU and making it too easy would invite people to drop in and out as it pleased them.

They certainly knew they couldn't produce any unicorns, which is why the second the campaign is over, they all ran away into obscurity, cause for sure they didn't want to show the people they lied to for years that actually the EU isn't all bad (not perfect).May is only doing what she could be doing.

113600,10,Kupo_Master,"Pretty good analysis. The analysis of outcomes it spot on.I am skeptical about the extension in case of no deal though; I donâ€™t think the EU will accept it because it diminishes their own negotiating position. The reality of â€œno dealâ€ is that itâ€™s an extremely challenging situation to be in for the UK.Even forgetting the short/medium term pain around border management and business impact, it leaves the UK in a virtually untenable position with its biggest neighbour.The UK will need to agree some sort of trading / diplomatic relationship with the EU.

This crisis is completely self inflicted.May is also to blame for not preparing the country for _any_ kind of Brexit, leaving businesses and government completely in the dark on what's going to happen, four months from the date. When one of the options includes things like food shortages. Of course more of the blame is on Cameron who should not have made the referendum question so deceptively simple. Lots of wildly different possibilities are all grouped under ""leave"", it was always a given that whatever form it would eventually take would only be liked by a minority.The blame is on all of UK politics for still considering a 52-48 result valid when the Leave side was guilty of illegal campaign funding, and huge lies, ties with Russia, and so on. The referendum result should have been declared invalid by Parliament.Nobody in UK politics had tried to find a compromise between the sides even though an extremely close result calls for that.

Advocates denounced the German government leaders who signed the Armistice on November 11, 1918, as the ""November Criminals"" (German: NovemberÂ­verbrecher).When the Nazis came to power in 1933, they made the legend an integral part of their official history of the 1920s, portraying the Weimar Republic as the work of the ""November criminals"" who stabbed the nation in the back to seize power while betraying it. The Nazi propaganda depicted Weimar as ""a morass of corruption, degeneracy, national humiliation, ruthless persecution of the honest 'national opposition'â€”fourteen years of rule by Jews, Marxists, and 'cultural Bolsheviks', who had at last been swept away by the National Socialist movement under Adolf Hitler and the victory of the 'national revolution' of 1933"".Scholars inside and outside Germany unanimously reject the notion, pointing out the German army was out of reserves, was being overwhelmed by the entrance of the United States into the war, and by late 1918 had lost the war militarily.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",e9sxbvh,e9sxbqj,9xg9bi,0.999895532,0.999791065,Brexit,16-11-18

113670,10,iamnotinterested2,"February 28, 2017 5:00 amÂ byÂ David Allen GreenBrexit will be shaped by the World Trade Organization in at least three ways.First, the so-called â€œWTO optionâ€ would be the default position if there is no trade agreement between the UK and EU (and indeed between the UK and anywhere else) when the UK leaves the EU. The UK would then have to apply the same tariffs and other measures to all imports, including those from the EU. The extent to which this outcome is feared will affect whether any trade deals are achieved in time. The WTO option is the cold hard floor on which the UK will splat down if no safety net is in place in time.Second, the WTO provides rules for what can and cannot be done with trade agreements. For example, sector-specific agreements are not permitted. Agreements have to cover a substantial portion of trade. A country cannot just pick cherries, or any other item, as a specific subject for a trade deal. There can, for example, be no deals just for automobiles from Germany or anywhere else.And third there are the schedules, the subject of this post. In the days leading up to the referendum result last June, and afterwards, there was serious concern that the UK getting its own schedules at the WTO would be difficult and risky. Re-establishing the UKâ€™s place at the WTO seemed to present yet another grand problem thrown up by Brexit, without any easy solution.The UK does not need to reapply to the WTO on leaving the EU. The UK is a member in its own right, even though it currently operates through the bloc. And so the UKâ€™s detailed WTO commitments on tariffs and barriers to trade are set out in schedules shared with the EU. On Brexit, the UK will need toÂ have its own schedulesÂ and for those schedules to be certified, there must be no objections by any other WTO members.Some have speculated that the ability of any member of the WTO to veto proposed changes would mean the UK was at the mercy of countries playing politics with ulterior motives, say by Argentina over the Falklands or by Spain over Gibraltar. As such, the WTO was another ironic example of a process supposedly about â€œtaking back controlâ€ handing real power of the UKâ€™s post-Brexit fate to the whims of outside powers.The secretary-general of the WTO contributed to these fears. The month before the referendum, Roberto AzevÃªdoÂ warned of tortuous Brexit trade talks:Pretty much all of the UKâ€™s trade [with the world] would somehow have to be negotiatedâ€¦It is a very important decision for the British people. It is a sovereign decision and they will decide what they want to decide. But it is very important, particularly with regard to trade, which is something very important for the British economy, that people have the facts and that they donâ€™t underestimate the challengesâ€¦It is extremely difficult and complex to negotiate these trade agreements. And slow as well. Even if you are in a position to negotiate quickly with all these other members it doesnâ€™t mean that they will be in a position to negotiate with you because they have their own priorities.â€œWTO chief says post-Brexit trade talks must start from scratch,â€Â reported the Guardian. This did not look at all good. But by October 2016, Mr AzevÃªdo appeared to have shifted his position and seemed almost nonchalant. â€œBrexit will not cause UK trade â€˜disruptionâ€™ â€“ WTO boss,â€ reported Sky News after an interview with the organisationâ€™s secretary-general.

Labour's manifesto for the October 1974 general election had promised that the people would decide ""through the ballot box"" whether to remain in the EC.This was the first national referendum ever to be held throughout the entire United Kingdom and remained the only UK-wide referendum until the 2011 referendum on alternative voting was held thirty-six years later and was the only referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with Europe until the 2016 referendum on continued EU membership.The electorate expressed significant support for EC membership, with 67% in favour on a national turnout of 64%. The referendum result was not legally binding; however, it was widely accepted that the vote would be the final say on the matter and would be politically binding on all future Westminster Parliaments.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",e9t71he,e9t71c9,9xg9bi,5.07E-05,-0.999898681,Against,16-11-18

We must preserve itÂ Â».Why talk about it nowÂ ? Because the current talk of extending the transition period past december 2020, without implementing tariffs on UK's fishery products, would create a situation deemed unsustainable for the rest of european fishermen.British fishermen would still be able to sell 75% of their catches to the EU, while EU fishermen would lose 50% of their current ressources.Gerard van Balsfoort, president of European Fisheries Alliance, a lobby representing 18000 fishermen totalling 3500 shipsÂ : Â«Â We are in favor of the customs union, as long as access to british waters is also maintained [â€¦] I'm very happy that  Nathalie Loiseau took a standÂ Â». Same position from the EU Parliament, with Alain Cadec (president of the fisheries commission) saying Â«Â A customs union is acceptable only if there's also an access to waters...

So .. here's the deal for how it happened for us:1) Invite us to some all expenses paid 'exhibition' up in Wembley arena or somewhere similar. 'We'll get a taxi to bring you here, you'll get given goodies and shit' .. may as well go .. its a laugh isn't it!2) When we get there, they start plying you with champagne. Seemingly by the bucket, if that's your thing. Loud music, food, fun fun fun time. Whole day as much champers or beer as you want.3) 2 words. Pretty girls. Hired pretty girls to talk to, to flirt with you, to smile at your shit jokes. Bloody hordes of them. They look gorgeous. Look at one for over 1 second and she'll walk up to you, smile, brush against your arm and tell you how amazing you are and how Germany is full of girls like them who LOVE the English accent etc. Oh, and they're wearing hotpants and very tight tops with 'We love Franfurt' on them etc. They're getting drunk with us. Our new best friends. Most of us ugly munters have never had this before. The girls are clever too, they can tell when a guy doesn't want to play along with that sillyness and quickly move on. Most do want to play along though, very much so.4) Loads of stalls where pretty girls talk to you about how frigging fantastic Frankfurt is, how its parties and champagne and pretty girls and parties and fun fun fun and perhaps we could come out and party with them if we move there they LOVE English guys. It's corny as hell and frankly ridiculous, but we goddam love it!!!!5) Loads of stalls and talks where stuffy old suits talk to you about 15 reasons why the city is doomed and if we stay where we are we're screwed and facts about how Germany has to be the future and look at this chart it shows London has got to go down the toilet after Brexit..6) Lots of enthusiastic men talk about Â£300,000 a year wages with 150% guaranteed bonuses and do you prefer a Â£70,000 merc or a Â£72,000 BMW and which one do you drive at the moment OMG a Â£11,000 Toyota oh deary me really?7) Lots of brightly-suited men talk to us about the nightlife and the British-style pubs and the climate and Frankfurt being awesome and all moving expenses paid with 30K chucked in as well as 'settling in' money, with backdrop video of people having a right laugh, um, I presume in Frankfurt.8) Now, bring back the hordes of pretty girls and champagne. Look, the pretty girls are pinning 'I love Frankfurt' badges to us now. There's a Â£6k prize draw for anyone who can get 2+ colleagues to come to the next 'exhibition' but we're talking more about how we could sneak into another one.. 3 of my mates are so pissed they're singing and telling me how this is bloody brilliant and 1 mate has a pretty girl now sat on his knee and the other is talking about clearing his mortgage in 2 years and there is drunken conversation about what's cheating and what's not. All the married guys have turned their phones off. One of the girls is so pissed she let's slip she's actually from Croydon, not Frankfurt, but isn't supposed to tell anyone, we're all so pissed it just gets laughed off. Our German host brings another bottle of champagne and sits with his arms around us like we're now his best mates which makes us feel uncomfortable so he stops and is quickly replaced by another hottie and he tries to be our best mate from the other side of the couch.9) Finished? Of course we'll pay for your taxi home. That's how your life would be in Frankfurt, after all... What? England doesn't treat you like this? Why are you here then?10) [2 weeks later] .. Hey, Mr Britboy? I'm that suit from Deutsche Bank that talked for 7 minutes to you, I'm prepared to offer you a interview with our CEO on the spot right now if you want it .. yes of course in Frankfurt ...we're ready when you are .. we'll cover flights, expenses - do you enjoy 5 star hotels?

She never wanted to implement Brexit in the first place. Now she is threatening her cabinet, her party, and the parliament that if they don't accept her Brexit deal which nobody, Leaver or Remainer, likes, Brexit won't happen at all.

114019,10,sxh967,"Let's simulate the knock-on effects of a second referendum (whichever way it goes) Please feel free to provide your own version of what you think would happen in various scenarios. I'm a Brexiteer but I'm going to try to keep my analysis as non-partisan as I can (ie - what I think would happen as opposed to what I want to happen) - it would be great if you could do the same.**Preface**I'm going to break this into various segments, to go through the potential forms a referendum might take.**REFERENDUM A - 3 choices = Chequers, No-Deal, No-Brexit****A1 - Chequers win**I think this highly unlikely, but if Chequers wins, it gives the PM much more firepower in bullying MPs into agreeing to her deal. She would be sort of vindicated and would take it also as a cue to stay on as PM. The end-result would likely be that Parliament votes through the Chequers deal, and then the EU would probably be a bit cheeky and ask for (and get) some last minute changes, knowing that Parliament would be too fatigued to go through the whole process again. **A2 - No-Deal win**I also think this is unlikely because the Brexit vote would be split, but if No-Deal wins, I predict that the PM would resign after a few weeks and a Brexiteer would replace her. Regardless of whether I want a Brexiteer MP (I do) I don't think the government would have any credibility if it appointed a Remainer to handle No-Deal. I also don't think a no-deal result would cause no-deal - I think it would lead to something like a 6-month extension in negotiations (passed in an emergency vote in Parliament and hastily agreed to by the EU because shit actually gets done when it's convenient) and then we might end up with something like a Canada-deal. **A3 - No-Brexit win**In Referendum A, I think No-Brexit is most likely because the Brexiteer vote would be split. Remainers who previously accepted we were just leaving would know that Remain has an (unfair, in my view) advantage and would vote accordingly. I personally don't think the national split has really changed from 2016, but with a split in the Brexiteer vote, No-Brexit win would be virtually guaranteed. In this scenario, I think the government would end up passing a motion to revoke article 50, Parliament would agree and the EU would (obviously) welcome us back with open arms. Some people might say the EU would be hostile and angry at the (sort of) waste of 2 or 3 years, but the aversion of political turmoil would mean red win all round. **REFERENDUM B - 2 choices = Chequers v No-Deal****B1 - Chequers win**Pretty similar to A1, but I think the actual result would be pretty tight. As a result, I think Chequers would be passed but perhaps the EU would refrain from adding anything extra in fear of causing another political storm in the UK and potentially still causing no-deal.**B2 - No-Deal win** In this scenario, No-Deal has a pretty good chance of getting over the line. From the people I talk to, I can't find many Brexit supporters who like the deal the PM has come back with. Trying to read the mood I say that we would have 2 kinds of people voting for No-Deal: Brexiteers who prefer it to the PM's deal, and Remainers who (probably rightly) believe the government doesn't have the balls to follow through with No-Deal. **REFERENDUM C - 2 choices = Chequers v No-Brexit****C1 - Chequers win**Similar to A1 and B1, but here the EU would probably feel they have a little more room to squeeze the UK, knowing that it would be on the edge of just remaining altogether. **C2 - No-Brexit** Practically identical to A3. Given that we have a government and Parliament that is generally opposed to Brexit, Somehow I think they would have a much smoother ride in honouring the referendum this time around (conveniently). Brexit would probably be stopped within 6 months. **REFERENDUM D - 2 choices = No-Deal v No-Brexit**Note I think this format would only be offered in the event that the PM were to step down and be replaced (by either a Remainer or Brexiteer). For as long the PM is in place, her Chequers deal would always be on the ballot paper - not including it would be an admission of failure on her part and she would be under immense pressure to just resign. **D1 - No-Deal win**In this scenario, we would be at a point where Brexit has become so big that it has consumed 2 PMs. I think at this point, genuine No-Deal would be a real possibility. If we had a Remainer PM, we would probably end up something in-between Chequers and Canada (or even parking in EFTA until someone has a new idea), whereas a Brexiteer PM would mean immediate preparations for no-deal. **D2 - No-Brexit win**As mentioned above. We would simply end up not leaving the EU. **Further thoughts**Remainers are (quite intelligently) calling for another referendum knowing full well that they have nothing to lose at all. I personally don't agree with them but trying to remove myself from the situation, I can't really blame them. **Why?**If they lose the referendum and Brexit wins again, we will still have the problem we do now with Parliament itself being generally against Brexit, most of the Cabinet being against Brexit, all the opposition parties (except UKIP) being against Brexit, Whitehall being against Brexit, big business being against Brexit. *In other words, practically nothing changes if they lose another referendum.*If they win, however, they have the power of the abovementioned behind them, and cancelling Brexit becomes extremely likely. **Any thoughts?**Thanks for reading my ramblings.

Is it at all conceivable that Theresa May will come out of this fiasco as the hero who saved the UK from Brexit?When she took on the role of PM she had no choice but to (appear to) follow through with the result of the referendum.  But she must also have known, as many of us have, that to do so would inflict great damage and is in no way in the interests of the country.As time has passed and the lies of the Leave campaigners have become apparent, slowly the slight margin in June 2016 toward leaving has been reversed.  The deal that May has arranged is clearly not good enough for either Leavers or Remainers.  Maybe she knew this would be the case.  All she has to do now is sit tight and wait for the weight of public opinion to change.  And it is now doing just that.  She has said all along that there would be no second referendum or ""People's Vote"".  She has insisted that the UK will leave on March 29th.  Had she done otherwise, she would have opened herself up to all manner of criticism and perhaps would not have lasted this long.If she survives this no confidence motion, she can use it as an opportunity to put the question to the people again.

Taking it while saying ""no deal is better than a bad deal"", while stressing her commitments to unionists who she's denying a vote to (in explicit breach of the GFA) - that was ridiculous. She also simply has not thought through ""what when the EU changes"". The actual far right (not the UK let's insult them by calling them the far right of Brexiters) has been on the rise in Europe, and the EC's remit expands.

114108,10,ajehals,"It is. I tend not to hide that I voted leave, but I've been in plenty of situations where it has simply been assumed that I voted remain and.. well, it tends to be quite unpleasant because people get angry, offensive and (more often than not) pretty stupid. There was a fairly long period where working out if anyone else had vote leave in the various groups I circulate in was quite an interesting process of nudges and winks, and then a period while people became comfortable enough.And I know that's the same on the remain side in leave areas when I've been in that situation too. It's a shame really, but unsurprising.That particular bubble is incredibly unhealthy and distorts reality horribly (I'm willing to bet that at least one person you know, who seems normal and sane is hiding that they voted leave..). Obviously that harms the debate, it makes discussing interesting compromises, or even just understanding why people voted how they did incredibly hard.  Outside of social media (which is toxic) and the actual media (and obviously there you have those dangerous rags like the Guardian and Independent skewing everything, leaving just the express and the mail to really give you an idea of what is going on..) people tend to be quite twitchy about going against the peer group grain. Indeed I'd argue its even worse than the Tory/Labour split.I don't think TV generally is that remain, I tend to find it mostly neutral. Comedy tends to be more remain, but then it has always been more lefty and the left is more remain.. Try and find a decent right wing comedian who isn't a twat or a throwback to a WMC in the 80's (I've tried, there aren't many..).  To a certain extent I'd also argue that the reason you see TV on the remain side (and right) is because remain *is* right about things like the economic impact/benefits of leaving. Not the hyperbolic shambles we often see in here, but the general gist (there isn't a better trade agreement with the EU than EU membership for example..). The arguments and discussion about things like where power sits, issues with regulatory approaches, the direction of the EU etc.. have taken a bit of a back seat at times, and if you believe the economy is the most important thing, I'd assume that that's what you'd engage in.Well, that and you have to make a real effort to look for media, including TV that challenges your assumptions.

114113,10,ajehals,"It annoys me too, it also annoys most of the people who I know who voted leave. Yes there is frustration about the negotiation and the government, but apart from one or two people (notably my local Kipper..) everyone seems to want the UK to leave the EU sensibly, and to use the negotiation time.  I see far more of the above online than when actually talking to people (or talking to people off public forums for that matter). Don't get me wrong, I'd argue that we should and are leaving the EU (I suppose that's the leave means leave bit) but there was supposed to be a period where we talked about the how, and had input into the political approaches (I know I tried to..).Indeed, while neither did. It is a stupidly complicated situation and there was never an easy exit, or a simple solution.But lets also not forget that the referendum was supposed to set a direction; Leave and forge a new relationship and exit vs remain and be part of an evolving EU. The referendum wasn't supposed to be the end of the debate on everything, it was supposed to be a fork in the road. Unfortunately, a lot of the remain camp (I'd argue more so than the leave camp..) decided to spend 2 years trying to refight the referendum, and then get a new one, or simply terminate the exit. On the leave side there was more of a view that the UK was leaving, and that it was time to move on to talking about what that meant (which is what the last couple of days have been about after all).Indeed. Of course I'd argue that leaving the EU is a benefit in and of itself in terms of what that does to where competencies are exercised, but you are right, it requires a realignment and a healthy political process that gets us to the 'new' direction.  We are lacking that at the moment, and while I had hoped it might come between the referendum and triggering A50 (that was squished by the EU not wanting to do any pre-negotiation..) or at least during the negotiations, it sort of hasn't because a lot on the remain side have refused to engage on it beyond trying to push the UK to remain.I've had better conversations with other leave voters about softer and harder brexits, and trying to accommodate the fact that the referendum was close (I mean obviously it is the will of the people in every possible way and a mandate..) than I did with remain voters.  Indeed a good 25% of the discussions I've had with remain voters I didn't know seemed to be about me proving I wasn't actually racists, or somehow mentally challenged. Of course it's all a bit late now.All I can say to that is that you are broadly wrong. Of course there are frustrated leavers, lots of them. They fought hard for a referendum, 'won' the argument, wanted to move on to the next bit, and have spent the time refighting the referendum... I mean, that's shit.  But the vast majority of leave voters I know (And again, I'm in my mid 30's and they are my peers, so it's not a perfectly representative group) are neither ignorant nor impatient (although one of them is Scottish so..).The campaigns were shite, but the information has been out there for a long time. From my perspective, I went from being on the fence to pro-leave over a few years where I was more engaged with EU politics and came to understand more about the EU. So the idea that people were simply badly informed doesn't resonate. I'd argue that the issue is and remains that some remain voters think that leave voters must be misinformed, because when looking at the same data, the same issues and the same outcomes, they are coming to a different conclusion.  That is about priorities and peoples aims.  If you asked me to vote purely on the economic question, ignoring governance entirely, I'd vote remain. Indeed if the EU were an economic project alone, I'd bet we'd be staying in. But it isn't..We had all the information we could reasonably expect. The only thing we didn't have was the detail of what the EU might agree to (And again, the EU refused to discuss that in advance..).  Now I understand the argument that people would like to have a say now, now that we have a draft withdrawal agreement, but that then ignores the fact that the direction people wanted was to leave the EU (and I think that's still true by the way, even the very small swing we've seen hasn't really been that people suddenly liked the EU, but rather that they still dislike the EU, but think that leaving will do more harm than it actually will..). In all honesty, I'd have loved a remain campaign that was more positive on the EU, that set out a vision for the future of the EU. I think they'd have lost by a larger margin, but at least it would have been a debate about two possible directions, two actual visions of the future, rather than one side presenting possibilities, and the other side predicting disaster.And if we do have another referendum, I'd also hope we ban the likes of Aaron Banks and Farage taking part, I swear that they scared off more on the fence leavers than they secured votes with the died in the wool ones (I mean, they weren't voting remain anyway..).",e9utsyw,e9usqjh,9xpnae,3.04E-09,-0.999999994,Against,17-11-18

If they can't mount a successful leadership challenge, the ERG's only play to stop her withdrawal deal is to vote it down in Parliament. So one would expect them to commit hard to that. The way things stand currently, it's difficult to see how May makes up those numbers (and lost DUP votes) without a big change in Labour's approach. That would seem to suggest no deal is currently looming larger.But things can change quickly, and one key aspect of May's deal that has yet to get much attention is that the major component of it, the future relationship, is still up for debate. Brexiteers could still fulfil their Canada plus ambitions, Labour could secure something softer per Corbyn's wishes. There may yet be quiet, strategic moves to let May's deal stand and refocus efforts on toppling her soon after Brexit, thereby avoiding the risk of being tagged as responsible for the harm of no deal, while having May as a convenient scapegoat to blame for future issues.

When all these things are happening, how is the result of any vote still legitimate? It's been distorted by outright undemocratic forces just outside of actual politics but deeply interwoven with them. In this kind of world, wouldn't ensuring that voters are not de facto agents of outside interests be more in tune with the original idea than letting people blindly cast a vote that's potentially counter to their interests?Sorry for the run-on wall of text.

You want your banks to serve European customers without hassle? Here, have some Polish plumbers in trade. And so on. Which seems to be what May has worked out with two exceptions.One being the UK's 'Membership Fees' to the EU. Obviously, one the one hand the UK agreed to pay the money and shouldn't be able to take it back. On the other hand, it'll be a membership fee for a club they're no longer a part of. This one has wiggle room but I assume the UK wouldn't want to be seen as going back on their word, though there should be some kind of tradeoff or rebate in general.Lastly, there is the matter of the Irish border and this is a true no-win scenario.

And that's assuming the current government agrees to have a second referendum, which they won't.So you first need another election, which Labour isn't guaranteed to win, and if they do win Labour's been very vague about what they intend to do with Brexit if it's up to them. Corbyn said he can get the same conditions they had as part of the EU after Brexit, but that's complete bollocks.The reality is that there isn't time for a change in government, setting up a second vote, then getting to work on implementing the result. There just isn't. The EU will not extend the deadline for a year, they've made it clear that such an extension would be weeks, not months, and they're not likely to agree to it without a very solid plan by whoever is in charge.There's a difference between optimism and wishful thinking, so if someone says there will 100% be a second referendum they need a serious reality check.

114816,10,AdventurousReply,"A new avenue for one of May's opponents? (Partial repost from a comment reply I made in a thread on ukpolitics):May's made the blunder of accepting an unacceptable offer. (One that disenfranchises NI over how they are regulated.) Previously, the two main political parties didn't realistically have the option of remain or a second vote until after exit. The establishment doesn't get to respond to a public vote with ""oh, that looks too hard so we won't"". But because May's deal is more binding than the EU treaty itself, she's unintentionally volunteered to carry the can for it.The extra avenue this opens up is:""May cocked up the process of exit. Bye bye May. What we're going to do is rescind notification, and then run a set of community consultations. These will include non-EU representatives to get a sense of what likely external FTAs are too. In that way we will establish what the public's preferred future relationship and future external FTAs are. And then we will re-hold the referendum"".That's not quite the People's Vote, because an immediate second referendum would still leave the Brexit side frustrated in not getting to discover what the FTAs would have been. Anyway, where previously it seemed constrained to land on no deal (if she accepted one, the Mexican stand-off would break and she'd fall, so she wouldn't accept one), it is now unclear which way it will go. Except that May looks like she's taken herself down with a gambit that, frankly, always looked suicidal because you can't disenfranchise a community.

They will have spent millions more on negotiating.

Lastly, do not underestimate the resulting lack of certainty. Who's to say that the UK might not vote for Brexit again in two years' time?

114913,10,satimal,"I understand your point of view, and we do have plenty of issues with representation in this country. First Past the Post is a terrible system and should have been scrapped years ago, it has blocked parties like UKIP out of parliament which left anti-brexit views unrepresented.  Your analogy is Lib Dems winning and getting a UKIP government is actually something that could legally happen within our Constitution, since the queen can legally appoint any government she wants. However if the result of an advisory referendum that was won with a majority of less than 2% isn't delivered it's not anti-democratic. Particularly when there was criminal rule breaking from official campaigns, and so much misinformation that the result would have been overturned if the same thing happened during a general election (see [Oldham East and Saddleworth 2010](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldham_East_and_Saddleworth_by-election,_2011) ).My opinion is actually the opposite to yours, because during the referendum everyone was talking about staying in the single market and customs union, but the idea that we have to leave the single market and customs union has been pushed through by a minority of MPs who don't represent any significant portion of the country. If you look at how the EU is structured, you have MEPs elected using a voting system called STV which means every party gets equal representation and allows for more than two parties to hold seats. This usually means one party doesn't hold a majority, but the head of the Commission will come from the largest party much like the PM does in the UK. What this means is that instead of a single party basically having complete control of the government and the commons with only around 40% of the vote, laws must be made that are acceptable to a majority of MPs from different parties, so the conservatives wouldn't have been able to do a lot of the stuff they've done in the UK under this system since it recognises that only 40% of the country voted for them. I think if we had vote reform, our votes would feel like they counted far more then they do currently, but the brexit referendum is not the vote to hold the country up to.

To stay healthy you will need fresh food such as vegetables and fruit - at a push some vitamin suppliments can be used but not recommended for long term use.The problem with flour (to make bread) is that it does not store well and only provides carbohydrates. Would recommend you also consider the following, which can be stored for at least two years, and sometimes three years.Salt - essential for good health (in the right quantities)Sugar - keeps for years if sealed properly.Pasta - can be eaten well beyond the best before date.Brown Lentils (inexpensive, don't need soaking, can be used for all types of dishes and are very tasty).Beans (including Baked Beans) - good for protein.Tinned Sardines, Tuna, pilchards.Spam and corned beef, often have a three year period before possibly going off.Condensed and powdered milk.A few tinned vegetables of your choice but be aware that according to the USDA, high-acid canned goods, like tomatoes and citrus fruits, will keep only for up to 1Â½ years.Knorr stock cubes (keeping in a cool container will extend their usable period) - useful for soups, stews, pasta, etcThese are just a few suggestions, No doubt you will have your own addditions.You might also want to think about things like tea candles (bees wax if possible otherwise only use in ventilated rooms) - some of us remember the three day weeks of the 70s when the electricity would go out for hours; matches; soap; washing up liquid and toilet paper.

Think of the times when thereâ€™s been a few inches of snow forecast.Also, buy a bread maker. You can make bread by hand if you have the time, but a bread maker will make it a lot easier; just chuck everything in the machine and leave it for a couple of hours.The chances are, most people have enough tinned soup and other non-perishables at home to last a couple of weeks. If you donâ€™t, now is the time to buy because supermarkets are already replenishing supplies quicker in the lead up to Christmas.If you commute to work by car, keep your tank full and buy some petrol/diesel cans and fill them up now; store them in the garage or in the shed. Again, not because there *will* be a fuel shortage, but because as soon as the end of March gets closer, people will begin to panic buy fuel.Stockpile enough supplies for your household to last 2-3 weeks.Iâ€™m not paranoid, but I think we all know what a couple of inches of snow has done before so this is just preparing for the worst while hoping for the best.Iâ€™d rather laugh it off next summer at how funny that Brexit scare was, than be sitting outside Tesco in April hoping for a delivery to come in.",NA,NA,9ybd3m,0.163699086,-0.672601829,Against,19-11-18

Governments change, people change, policy changes, narratives change.The idea of Brexit was always based on a reality that could never exist, weighed against a future under EU tyranny that would never come to pass.

While that may hold true when looking at relative prices in a local scope, when looking at it in terms of the country the assumption kind of breaks down. London has the highest house prices yet there are still people who consider themselves working class in London. Further to this, since high house prices are likely caused by demand, you could come to the conclusion that those areas have high levels of immigration and a higher immigrant population that makes them more likely to vote remain. They could just be more welcoming and Popular areas. There are plenty of other theories that can be formed.

115328,10,oriain,"None of this is about Ireland's ""greed"". Ireland isn't an expansionist empire looking to annex Northern Ireland. This simply comes down to a few points, all of which revolves around the Good Friday Agreement. I'm also replying to some other points you made below.1. While the GFA doesn't explicitly state that an open border is necessary to supporting the treaty, it is implied and was created at a time when both UK and Ireland were in the EU and there was no existing mechanism in which to leave. None of the authors of the treaty ever foresaw a situation where one party would leave the EU and leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights, which the UK is trying to now do. You're right when you say that the border is where it is and how the border shouldn't be placed in the middle of a country. But how do you think the border got there in the first place? The border in Ireland was created by the UK in the early 20th century as a fudge, partitioning Ireland into 2 entities. Regardless of which community you belong to, knowing that is to know that there will always be additional complexities around anything that will impact the relationship between Ireland and the UK. For much of the campaigning for Brexit, this idea was dismissed as ""Project Fear"" and as far as I could see was only properly discussed in NI, not anywhere else in the UK media.2. The GFA allows all citizens of Northern Ireland to choose to be a citizen of Ireland, the UK, or both. That is their right. By extension, any NI citizen who chooses Irish citizenship is also an EU citizen. Ireland and the EU are attempting to look after the rights of their own citizens. That is not greed. That is protecting their citizens own interests. I would not respect any country or organisation that would willingly and knowingly throw their citizens under an NHS Â£350m bus.3. Many industries in NI rely on access to Irish markets to be able to function. Just look at their dairy industry as an example. Dairy from NI is predominantly processed in IE facilities and sent back to NI for sale and distribution. A hard border will destroy those industries overnight. Likewise it will also heavily damage the economies of towns and communities on both sides of the border.4. Peace. You claim that Ireland's actions will be the instigators of violence, but everything Ireland has been pursuing has been in the name of peace. No one wants to return to the troubles, Ireland has given up its claim on NI, but from what I can see in the news every day Dublin is more invested in protecting the interests of all Northern Irish people than Westminster. There was even a poll recently that showed a huge number of British (or English, I don't precisely remember) voters believe violence in NI or losing NI from the Union as an acceptable price to pay for Brexit. That terrifies me! And I'm not even in NI.The people have unfortunately voted for Brexit, and so Westminster must deliver Brexit. That's fine. But thanks to the above all deriving from the history between UK and Ireland, it's not going to be as straightforward as some people think. We have a unique history where we created a unique peace treaty to address the unique needs of all citizens. An off the shelf solution was never going to work.",ea3fe6k,ea2g1y6,9yj51m,5.83E-09,-0.999999988,Against,20-11-18

115336,10,MindTheGaffe,"*Wall of text incoming, apologies in advance.*The 2022 is not a membership extension, it refers to the transition period. What the UK and EU are doing now is negotiating the withdrawal agreement: it's all about how the UK will leave the EU in terms of borders, ongoing financial obligations, citizen rights, etc. Then on March 29th the UK is no longer a member of the EU. That deadline can be moved a little bit, but the EU has made it clear such an extension would be weeks, not months. At that point the transition period begins which is set to last till the end of 2021, and that's when negotiations begin on the future relationship between the UK and the EU. That's when trade deals and the like are going to be negotiated, and is intended to smooth out the final exit process. That process can be extended to 2022, but at that point you will not have been an EU member anymore for 2 years already.**So extension or not, on the 29th the UK is out.**A people's vote, or second referendum, would have to be organised in the 5 months before then, or it's pointless, as you won't be an EU member past the 29th. Referendums after that are of course possible, but would mean the UK having to reapply for EU membership just like any other country would. The associated price tag could be considered significant, the UK would almost certainly no longer get the preferential treatment it enjoyed in the past few decades.So 5 months is all there is, but you'd have to cut some serious constitutional corners to make that happen. The first referendum took a year to set up, and it's easy to see why: you need to have many, many debates on what question to even ask, what the possible answers are, what to do in the case of each possible outcome, and on other conditions surrounding a referendum, like minimum voter turnouts and thresholds (do we leave or stay at 50% +1, or do we require a minimum of 60%, 70%, etc). Then you need to pass the required laws to actually have the referendum, the law also requires about 10 weeks time for both sides to campaign, and then you'd have to actually implement the result. And all that is assuming the current government goes along with it, if not you'd require a general election first, adding to the time pressure. So in short, Brexit is almost certainly going to happen. The only way it could be avoided entirely is if May herself cancels it, and I don't see that happening.

115583,10,RoyalHelicopter,"Mostly sentiment. Those that tend to fiercely defend leaving the EU are generally those that tend to go on about the ""good ol' days"". Everything seems prettier through the rose glasses of nostalgia. The reality is that the world of today doesn't resemble the world of the 1960s or 1970s. Economies are significantly more interconnected and UK-centric globalism has further declined to the benefit of  US/Chinese-centric globalism. The British Empire has further continued its decline during the post-WWII era and the UK has lost most of its influence overseas (e.g. Hong Kong). Thinking that we could just go back to the good old days is a pure fiction. It's also pure fiction to suggest that we are worse off in the EU than prior to joining the EU. We are not. The EU has established a single market, whose economic power is a force to be reckoned internationally. Individually, each member state wouldn't be getting the trade deals, the EU gets on behalf of its members. The argument of taking back control is also a silly sentimental argument at best. In a globalised world with rising nationalist tendencies - global anarchism among nations if you want -  it boggles the mind seeing people arguing to leave an economically more powerful bloc where they have a voice in determining the rules and actions (both directly via European elections and indirectly by British emissaries) to rely on your own economic power and having to accept terms dictated by stronger economic entities (e.g. the US, China, the EU). Sovereignty is a notion that is highly debatable in today's world. First, most nations are heavily indebted to the point that they depend entirely on the good graces of their creditors. Second, having absolute sovereignty (as in: We dictate all the terms) is no guarantee of success. It is, however, a recipe for disaster. Modern perception of sovereignty - and the underlying reasoning as to why the EU does not remove any sovereignty - has always been nations chose of their own to be part of an international treaty and subsequently remove itself from a treaty. At the end of the day, there is, however, no certainty as to whether leaving or staying in the EU is economically sound. We don't have the ability to predict the future. Maybe the EU will perish as many Brexiteers expect. Maybe the UK will make a horrible mistake by leaving. We can't honestly answer that question until after we have left. What we can do - and what we have been doing - is analysing the potential up- and downsides of each option.Overall, I believe that the upsides of leaving are vastly overstated as they often 1) ignore the trade with third countries that occurs thanks to EU treaties with those nations (e.g. US-EU trade deals, EU-CA trade deals) and 2) assume that once we leave that we can continue trading with the EU as before when there is absolute certainty that this won't be the case.We are then trading certainties for potential economic benefits that may not materialise until the late 2020s (you wouldn't believe how long negotiating FTA takes) based on sentimental reasons (some Brexiteers have outrighted called to reestablish the British Empire).

And so the UK could allow goods in from the EU tarrif free.(Additionally it would benefit the UK to unlilaterally allow goods in with zero tariffs.)The taking control of borders argument is largely about immigration and about ability to trade with other countries without EU oversight. And more importantly it's about having British courts deciding cases not European ones and having parliament decide on regulations, not Brussels. The issue is not about trading. Brexiters like free trade. If the EU was just about free trade in goods and services they wouldn't want to leave.As far as safety regulations go, the UK would still he allowed to prevent the importing of unsafe products under WTO rules. Most of the jobs lost to free trade have already occurred in the past 50 years. Very little will occur with further opening in large part because low end manufacturing doesn't occur in meaningful levels in the UK.But the UK stands to gain significantly from free trade with Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand, Japan Taiwan, South Korea etc. (But on net the UK will probably be worse off because of the gravity theory of international trade.)As far as the EU imposing a border - yes they will need to. But it need not be that bad. They can quickly  wave through consignments that originate in the UK. And there are ways to use technology to validate that in advance.They don't need to worry about individual cars other than checking a passport. And that too can be sped up.

115724,10,flying_mango_pie,"I did some background reading and the original rebate was ""necessary"" because the UK was charged too much relative to it's GDP. And that was because Germany vin particular was very stingy wrt the original accession agreement. The UK agreed to almost every EEC demand. There was no real negotiation.Luckily Harold Wilson didn't care. He thought the UK needed to be in it for reasons relating to international relations.Anyway, that and being rejected twice by the French poisoined relations. Had the UK joined during the post war boom with the other countries negotiating in good faith it would have changed public opinion.As far as the opt outs in regards to the euro- well a common currency without a federal government is madness and impedes economic well being. Schengen was a big no no because the UK is magnet for immigration. It has more than double the population density of France. It keeps rising by hundreds of thousands a year yet because of strict green belt laws ot has extreme housing shortages. And yes EU citizens can already come in unlimited numbers, I'm just talking about non EU citizens coming illegally from the EU.The British press has been ""bad"". Ironically the Daily Mail has a new editor and has changed it from being anti EU. Had the new guy been there 5 years ago the you probably would have voted to remain.I am a little mystified about what you said though. Because other governments have notoriously cheated or just not enforced EU laws. Italy comes to mind. Poland and Hungry are flagrantly violating basic liberal democratic traditions. The UK traditionally has rigorously enforced EU law.And Germany together worth France (to the best of my understanding) basically decide EU policy behind the scenes. Most of the other members just fall into line except if the issue is something they seem dire. So is perhaps some of the anger related to the UKs refusal to kowtow to Germany? I can't defend the present British government - it's been a mess. But had the EU not insisted on a lack of Irish border controls the process could have surely proceeded more easily. And it would have helped if the will would have agreed to negotiate trade and the WA simultaneously.The UK agreed to pay up a huge exit bill.

Seriously, go look up the Good Friday Agreement, the Troubles, and when you can come back and tell us why there shouldn't be a border between North Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, I'll listen to your ideas.If you want me to explain more, I can try.  Once upon a time the UK conquered Ireland.  It wasn't much more than any other colony that the UK had.  You may have heard stories about how badly the UK was treating Ireland, perhaps you heard of the Potato Famine.  Ireland fought for its independence, and mostly got it back.  The UK held on to the north, and made it part of the United Kingdom.  The Irish in North Ireland wanted to be part of Ireland, and the British in NI wanted to be part of the UK.  There was lots of fighting. Neighbors blowing each other up.  UK security was very high, since they would occasionally put bombs in London too over this.Someone came up with an agreement that Irish people can be part of Ireland, and UK people can be part of the UK, and we can pretend the area belongs to both countries.  Amazingly, this agreement worked and people stopped putting bombs in places to hurt each other.  Part of this agreement says there will never be a border between NI and Ireland; after all, if there was a border, we can't pretend it's part of Ireland now, can we?Now, who knows what will happen.  A border might come out of a hard brexit, and while I'm certain people will attempt to dismantle it, I'm not sure it will get as militarized as it did, nor wanton bombs everywhere.  You might not be old enough to remember the troubles, but I think the people that do want peace.  But when you say ""Why can't we have a border?"", people will imply that you mean ""let's go back to the 90s when we called them terrorists!""

Mind you this does not mean antagonize the UK, but it means that the EU is not taking risks or weakening itself to serve the UK's needs.The UK needs stopped being the EU needs the moment you voted to leave.Now of course the EU is more than willing to cater to the UK if there is a exchange of favors, if the UK is willing to offer the EU something the EU wants in exchange for what they want, but they have no reason to do that for free.2) The UK has very little to offer to the EU.This is something the brexiters and empire nostalgic have the hardest time understanding.The UK reacts as if Brexit is going to be the downfall of the EU.As if the brexit fee is what separates the EU from impending bankruptcyAs if the UK withdrawal would take away irreplaceable resources from the EU.and ... well.. none of that is true.As a matter of fact Brexit is such little concern to the EU that while it has taken centerstage in every political discussion in the UK, in EU most people don't even know if it happened already or not.The truth is the EU is way more ready for the No deal brexit that the UK constantly invokes as a threat. As a matter of fact the EU is operating on the not unfounded assumption that the UK is not reliable enough to be trusted to come with a workable deal before the bitter end.3) A UK - EU deal has to exist in the context of international deals.The UK operates as if the deal between the UK and the EU exists in a universe apart from every other deal.Yet it has always been the political stance of the EU to have specific rules and specific demands to the entire world and operate their deals based on how much those countries they align to them.The Canada Deal, the Norway Deal, every other Deal are about a third party nation operating within the boundaries or the EU framework of freedoms and rights.That is the way a colossal market that unites 27 countries works.To change the terms for the UK is not an isolated affair. is to announce to the rest of the world that more is available for those conditions.The UK operates as both the deal with the UK will be a private matter and the UK is a better partner to the EU than literally the entire rest of the world and it is wrong in both accounts.4) ExceptionalismThe UK continues to operate as if their country was a special case and different from any other country to deal with the EU.The unfortunate part is, this is true but in a negative way.the UK possesses overseas territories that have very problematic implications that were somewhat dampened by their membership in the EU but are going to become a serious issue as they exit.Most notably Northern Ireland and Gibraltar.They have always been an issue before, but being in a single market and under an umbrella of common regulation that helped defusing the issue, after all they can be nominally in a different country but still under the umbrella of the EU.Now the UK is in the position where if Ireland or Spain decide they want to let Brexit die on the hill of their contested territory they can just do that.That means not only that like explained in the points before there are no reasons for the EU to give the UK a better deal than everyone else, but there are pretty good reasons to not even concede to the UK the same terms they would concede to a different Third party country.5) Overplaying their handGiven the situation the UK should really take any offer the EU is willing to throw their way and say thank you, and the EU has been so far EXTREMELY generous with the conditions they offered.Yet the UK has constantly refused to accept the EU offers expecting more.There is no scenario in which the UK gets more.And worse the UK is constantly overplaying their power in this negotiation. as said above the constant threat of an Hard brexit is the most obvious example since the UK will be devastated by a no deal while the EU would be mildly inconvenienced and is preparing for it anyway.Even worse, this overplaying is causing the position of the UK to become worse as we speak with their economic services abandoning the island for europe.",ea6h4oz,9z1v47,9z1v47,1.20E-11,-1,Against,21-11-18

He remarked that if an alien landed a flying saucer in Brussels and walked around and observed, he would think that Ireland was a country of 60 million people and Britain was a country of 4 million people.Also I think the EU has been incredibly patient with Britain in the Brexit negotiations despite their position changing all the time and often being inconsistent, and the fact that you don't really know who's calling the shots - Theresa May may be the face showing up at meetings but BoJo, Farage, Arlene Foster, JMR etc. etc. can all torpedo the deal.

That's the entire point - outside of the EU's model it's a wild west of bilateral negotiations enforced by a wide variety of mechanisms. Don't think there are many true capital controls at play. In fact it's largely EU policy to avoid them even with 3rd parties. It's more the surrounding soft factors. Can you buy shares easily, open bank accounts etc. That type of thing has a significant impact on ease of doing business - and is one of the reasons the UK is/was so popular - easy beachhead into Europe with no friction.Unlike the other poster I wasn't really arguing this from a principle approach but rather practically.

115889,10,barryvm,"IMHO people over here in my country are not particularly annoyed about the UK government constantly changing position. Personally, I think this is the logical conclusion of a very inconvenient fact: remaining a member of the EU was always better for the UK than any version of leaving.Basically, Brexit trades away real control (a veto!) over EU regulations governing its economy and trade for the illusion of self-governance in an increasingly interconnected world. In practice, it will still need to conform to EU regulations if it wants to trade with the EU (and it would be economic suicide not to), potentially becoming a satellite state of the EU like Norway. I really find it surprising that people who voted for Brexit didn't realize this.That's a pretty charitable position to take. I would say that the UK government understood exactly what it was attempting to do. I don't know what the opinion in Ireland is but over here the impression was that the UK was trying to become a low-regulation backdoor into the EU with access to the common market but without all the trade/food/health/safety regulations that come with it (e.g. the Chequers plan).As for the Irish border, that's simply playing with fire. I don't know if they were ever serious about putting a customs border around Northern Ireland, thereby breaking the Good Friday Agreement, or were simply lying to their supporters there. In any case, this issue was entirely predictable from the start. In fact, I remember a political science professor predicting this very issue on the radio when the Brexit referendum results rolled in.All in all, Brexit is a tragedy, especially for the UK population and the consequences will haunt (and us) them for decades to come.

Oh, and also pay for 9 years of internet subscription each as well (as it's needed for the netflix).4)  Pay Â£350 million extra to the NHS each week, for almost 15 years.5)  Give every single homeless person in England a hot breakfast, hot lunch, and hot dinner, every single day, for the next 430 YEARS!!!!!!6)  Invest in UK companies in the FTSE.

115922,10,outhouse_steakhouse,"Showerthought: Britain never really understood the while point of the EU This is my opinion as an Irishman, not speaking for anyone else.When Britain joined the EEC, as it then was called, in 1973 (Brentrance?) you could argue that the Union was the rich man's club, and Ireland was the poor man of Western Europe being dragged in alongside Britain without any real choice. But the Union has evolved to be much more than a trading bloc. The policy of giving out structural funds to help poorer countries improve their infrastructure has shown itself to be not only a humanitarian gesture but a wise and far-sighted investment. Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU for several years now, and our exports are much more balanced, with a smaller percentage going to Britain and a larger percentage going to the Continent, making us less dependent on any one country. This is a good thing for everyone's stability and prosperity.Overall the EU has given a huge boost to Ireland's self-confidence and enabled us to come out from under Britain's thumb. After 800 years of colonization, the idea of being a member of a union of equals was a big novelty to us. Also, our strong constitution has given Ireland an outsized role in shaping the evolution of the EU, by requiring integration treaties to be put to a referendum while other countries' parliaments simply presented their citizens with a *fait accompli*. Irish voters have sent Brussels bureaucrats back to the drawing board a couple of times, and I believe the result has been a better Europe for both Ireland and the EU as a whole.Also I want to stress the importance of the Four Freedoms (freedom of movement for goods, services, capital and people) and the fact that they are indivisible and cannot be cherry-picked (since otherwise, large rich nations would have an unfair advantage over small poor ones). The Irish don't feel threatened by freedom of movement for individuals because emigration is in our DNA, and freedom to travel and work abroad has always been a safety net. Freedom for other people to come to Ireland has by and large been welcomed as bringing new and interesting cultures to what was sometimes a pretty monotonous society.All of the above explains why the EU enjoys astronomical support in Ireland. You may hear of ""Irexit"" but I assure you it is a pure astroturf group, made up of a handful of Ukip-aligned figures and with statistically zero support on the ground.Now of course Britain has had a very different historical experience as an Imperial power, and consequently developing a certain hubris and an image of itself as a colossus divinely ordained to bestride the globe. The loss of the empire was a huge trauma, and one might suspect that Britain entered the EU in the hope of turning it into Empire 2.0. The realization that to stay in the club, you had to play by the club's rules, was something the British always had a very hard time with, resulting in an endless stream of breathless, outraged and often totally [fake](https://blogs.ec.europa.eu/ECintheUK/euromyths-a-z-index/) stories about ""loony Brussels bureaucrats"" in the British media.I would say the Britain never really understood the basic nature of the EU as a union of equals rather than a hierarchy. Theresa May telling Donald Tusk that [""Britain is larger and more important than Ireland'](https://twitter.com/cellsatwork/status/994667150316130315?s=20) underscores this. No, Britain is not more important than Ireland. All countries matter, and small countries matter. Rich countries help to lift poorer countries up instead of preying on them, and the result is more prosperity for all, with the former poor countries in their turn lifting up new members and continuing the cycle.Maybe the EU just isn't a good fit for Britain until it gets this fundamental point, loses the imperial attitude and is willing to deal with other nations, even former colonies, as equal partners.

115934,10,Austifol,"A good write up and I agree with everything you say. You mentioned the collapse of the Empire, how living under a colonial ruler for generations became unacceptable for locals and they finally had enough. The rot had started on the outside, the outer fringes of the Empire and within the space of 60 odd years (between 1920s &amp; 1980s), had taken hold within Great Britain itself. Think of it, the Empire at its greatest reach in the 1920s, by 1960 the Empire was all but dead, and in another 20 years the country itself changed in a massive way. There is no doubt that the British were world leaders in engineering, born through a time when the rich titans of industry created railways and canals to sell their goods. But by the time the 1960s came around, the railways were in decline. The aircraft industry went from being world leaders to being nothing but parts suppliers to Airbus (I'm aware there is a bigger story here). The car industry was one of the largest in Europe, and today there's hardly a British car manufacturer left. All sold, wound up or bankrupt and only specialty manufactures, like Lotus or McLaren left. All the big British names left, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mini, Aston Martin, Vauxhall, Bentley &amp; Rolls Royce have long been sold off to other companies who have made them far more profitable and offer a better product than the original owners could have dreamed about. All of this comes down to this class structure they have inherited down through the generations. Time and time again, the 'gentlemen' of big business in their top hats kept telling the buyers what they wanted, never listened to workers and ended up paying the price through mass strikes and walkouts in the 70s and 80s. Such was the mistrust and infighting that product quality suffered and reputations went down the drain. At the same time, competitors from Germany and Japan proved successful.And here you have it again, this upper class dictating to others of the way the country should be run, without listening to the concerns of others. The sad fact is, you have regular members of the public who follow this creed, and when challenged as to their motivations, they can't give a satisfactory answer. They complain about immigrants sponging off the system, yet all the immigrants living around them are hard working and they'll admit that. It's a case of arguments reduced down to soundbites with no backup - like reading the headlines of the tabloids without actually reading the story. In the last 40 years, the best of British achievements has almost always been when they have partnered with another nation or group of nations and people from other countries.

The feeling over here can be summed up as ""the UK is trying to have its cake and eat it"". It is highly unlikely the EU will refuse to continue negotiating, but equally unlikely that they'll change position at the eleventh hour. The EU cannot allow the UK to ""pick and choose"" from the rights and duties of member states because doing so would mean prioritizing the demands of third country over the interests of its own members.I can think of one thing the UK government can do to convince them to do that: ask for a delay to allow them to put the final deal before the public in a referendum. Contrary to what some people seem to think democracy is important to the EU and it is highly unlikely they will refuse if a request for a delay is framed as an appeal to popular sovereignty.It seems to me that the UK political class is finally becoming aware of a very basic (and inconvenient) truth: that staying in the EU is much more beneficial to the UK than any variant of leaving. ""beneficial to the UK"" here means that for the majority of the population EU membership brings more economic and social benefits  than leaving would. That's not to say that leaving wouldn't be beneficial to some: I think there are a lot of people who stand to gain a lot by tearing down the rules and health/safety/trade regulations mandated by the EU, it's just that these people are a tiny minority. IMHO the whole debate has degraded into an emotional one: on a rational basis it is clear that ""taking back control"" is an illusion in a world that has become increasingly interconnected and cooperative (e.g. the appearance of large economic/political blocs). Political cooperation and integration will be necessary to tackle the problems ahead (climate change, an aggressive Russian government, the USA political system imploding upon itself, a rise in authoritarianism across the world, looming financial crises, ...). Frankly, I vastly prefer being part of a powerful bloc of more or less like minded people than the uncertainty of being part of a tiny country with little or no influence on world affairs. IMHO it's simply an extension of other forms of social organization (unions, countries, communities, ...) with similar drawbacks and benefits. Practically, if the UK leaves, it will become a satellite state of either the EU or the USA without much influence over the policies of either bloc. I have not yet heard a credible strategy on how to prevent this. Apparently a lot of UK citizens think otherwise (and that is their right), but I've yet to hear a single rational argument on how Brexit would benefit the UK population.",ea83c3h,9zc4s1,9zc4s1,1.85E-07,-0.99999963,Against,22-11-18

A modicum of critical thinking or a simple internet search for conflicting opinions is all it takes. It's not as if the current situation is difficult to understand: I didn't know anything about the process and implications of the UK leaving the EU but a few hours reading, spaced out over a few months, brought me mostly up to speed. Even with this limited knowledge it was clear to me that Brexit was a spectacularly bad idea and I couldn't really comprehend why so many people supported (and still support) it. I really hope I'm wrong about this but I'm fairly sure that I am not.In any case, I always find it strange that people who distrust the EU's motives never seem to question the motives of the newspapers or nationalist politicians lambasting it. Being critical of the EU is good, it has a lot of faults and room for improvement, but why not extend this same skepticism to the newspapers and politicians who attack it ? Why do people trust them, and not the people that make up the EU's ruling bodies (people they elected, directly or indirectly) ? Frankly, even after a cursory look over some of the principle pro-Brexit politicians in the UK, I have serious doubts about their motives: most seem to be motivated solely by personal self-interest. Either they don't realize the gravity of the problems they're causing for the people they represent, or they simply do not care.Good luck to you and I hope the move wasn't too uprooting.

And each choice in negotiations will no doubt be a matter of bitter dispute and acrimony in Westminster. This solves nothing.4/Thereâ€™s no way of knowing now how those choices will pan out, so, despite a generous and relatively detailed view of whatâ€™s possible, Parliament will be voting blind when it comes to what will actually come out at the end. 5/And when it does arrive, with a negotiation having been conducted by a secretive Government that prides itself on trying to circumvent Parliamentary involvement, Parliament will, eventually, have little choice but to accept it or face a new cliff edge. 6/If Parliament agreed this now, it will have, in the words of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, â€œsquandered its resistance, on a pocketful of mumbles such are promises.â€ 7/7PS â€œall lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.

But that should have happened a year a go or so.B) Deals between sovereign states are based on trust - as there is no world goverment. And they are between governments, not between peole. What if UK kicks out May and the Tories. Corbyn is also a brexiteer. If labour would decide to remain - what would happen in the next month. Everything could change. That wouldn't be a good basis for any deal. There are good reasons to critise the german electoral system. 16 years Merkel is a litte bit to long. I'd agree that this is kinda undemocratic.

You always need some parts, some raw material, etc which comes from other country. Hence you need trade. For last 40 yrs or so , UK as a part of EU, used to 'enjoy' good deals which the block as a whole used to negotiates with ROW. If UK goes out , without any deal. 1. They cannot access the common market IN EU like they used to. So essentially they have to pay high tariffs for all goods they import from a country in Europe ( the highest rates i.e WTO rates)2. All the deals with ROW with EU , cease to exists for UK. So again you start with 0 deals. SO UK has 0 deals with any other 160 countries in the world. SO anything which you buy from outside world you may the maximum tariffs. 3. When you start negotiating trade deals again , with say US  or EU or China, India , everyone knows UK is in desperate position and the deal will be heavily in favor of the other country. plus these deals are long drawn , i mean it could take decades to get 1 deal done. 4. More immediate issue would be the sheer amount of paperwork and friction in conducting trades with EU on say English channel. This means you need to declare whats in your truck, employ people who checks it. That would take time. Small businesses will need to take help of Trade agents to prepare the paperwork, pay them $$ upfront , before your goods are shipped. then pay relevant tariffs and taxes.

I don't think this because of the slim percentages on the win of last one, nor do I think that's what most 'Peoples Vote' protesters are arguing. I think a second referendum is required because the Brexit many believed would happen in 2016 is not the Brexit on the table in 2018. Sure, some would still rather we leave, but we have no way of telling to what extent the public has changed their minds until we perform a second democratic referendum on a decision that is going to affect all of our lives and our children's lives etc. (We can all find polls suggesting a new referendum would swing one way or another - they're unreliable, we need to go through the proper process)I think of it like moving house:A family with 3 children aren't quite happy with their neighborhood, as it doesn't offer everything to suit their children's needs.* Child 1 likes football* Child 2 likes swimming* Child 3 likes tennis Currently, their house is just a 5 minute walk away from a football pitch, and tennis courts, but no swimming facilities are located near by. So the parents ask the children ""If we can find a new bigger house, in close proximity to a football pitch, tennis courts AND a swimming pool, who would like to move?"" ... Of course the kids would vote 'Yes'.Now after searching the market, the parents can't quite find the house they were looking for. The best they can do is find a bigger house, which has a football pitch close by. Should the parents be absolutely required to go ahead with the moving of house, even though they couldn't find the house they promised the children just because the kids voted yes on the original suggestion? Of course not!They should ask the children again ""We can't find the house we original wanted, but we have been able to find a bigger house with a football pitch close by, but no tennis court or swimming pool. Do you still want us to move?""The point is, many seem to have voted in the first place on a deal which can now not be implemented.

Neither the Spanish government nor it's parliament would take such an obviously destructive step.If the status of Gibraltar and the issues surrounding it (e.g. tax evasion, smuggling) remain a point of contention after the UK leaves, Spain would probably take measures within the boundaries of international and EU law: it could create a ""hard"" land border with custom checks and an increase coast guard presence. The cost of these policies to the economy of Gibraltar could be severe but AFAIK there is no reason why any EU member would try to stop Spain from implementing them if they can show that these border issues harm their interests.",eaawv6r,eaaq058,9zlvu3,0.017330546,-0.965338908,Against,23-11-18

They don't have to explain how that good faith should be tested, leaving the question completely open to be addressed only in a future legal challenge. Would a Member take the risk of invoking a50 just for negotiation leverage if they had no certainty they could revoke it again? That Member would be hinging their entire strategy on just the possibility that a future legal challenge would work out in their favor. And they'd have to do it without explaining to their people the 'bad faith' intention of their move.Exploiting article 50 as a negotiation tactic can be very easily made a hugely risky and impractical step for anyone to take.

Especially given the fact Conservatives started losing in polls the moment May brought out a softer-than-expected deal. Where did all these votes go to? UKIP. This won't happen, because Tory base is a Brexiteer base - the moment they turn against Brexit is the moment they lose support because Remainers hate Tories no matter what and Brexiteers want Brexit no matter what, so they'd become a party without an electorate.All of that is simply wishful thinking.

116663,10,WikiTextBot,"**Eurabia**Eurabia is a political neologism, a portmanteau of Europe and Arabia, used to describe a conspiracy theory of globalist elements, allegedly led by French and Arab powers, to Islamise and Arabise Europe, thereby weakening its existing culture and undermining a previous alignment with the U.S. and Israel.The concept was coined by Bat Ye'or (pen name of Gisele Littman) in the early 2000s and is described in her 2005 book titled Eurabia: The Euroâ€Arab Axis.  Benjamin Lee of the  Centre for Research and Evidence on Security Threats at the University of Lancaster describes her work as arguing that Europe  ""has surrendered to Islam and is in a state of submission (described as dhimmitude) in which Europe is forced to deny its own culture, stand silently by in the face of Muslim atrocities, accept Muslim immigration, and pay tribute through various types of economic assistance."" According to the theory, the blame rests with a range of groups including communists, fascists, the media, universities, mosques and Islamic cultural centres, European bureaucrats, and the Euro-Arab Dialogue.The term has gained some public interest and has been used and discussed across a wide range of the political spectrum, including right-wing activists, counter-jihadis and different sorts of anti-Islamic, and conservative activists. Bat Ye'or's â€œMother conspiracy theoryâ€ has been used for further subtheories. The narrative grew important in expressing anti-Islamic sentiments and was used by movements like Stop Islamisation of Europe.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",eacqrbu,eacqr5i,9zroqz,0.986202636,0.972405271,Brexit,24-11-18

The term ""dumbing down"" originated in 1933, as movie-business slang used by screenplay writers, meaning: ""[to] revise so as to appeal to those of little education or intelligence"". Dumbing-down varies according to subject matter, and usually involves the diminishment of critical thought, by undermining intellectual standards within language and learning; thus trivializing meaningful information, culture, and academic standards, as in the case of popular culture.In Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste (1979), the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (1930â€“2002) proposed that, in a society in which the cultural practices of the ruling class are rendered and established as the legitimate culture of that society, that action then devalues the cultural capital of the subordinate social classes, and thus limits their social mobility within their own society.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",eacquuc,eacqumb,9zroqz,0.031034889,-0.937930221,Against,24-11-18

Given the commitment of the 'swivel eyed lunatics' to no deal, the only way Parliament reaches a majority on anything is if a faction of the Tory party finds agreement with enough of Labour, LD, SNP to form a majority coalition.They'd need to agree not just on wanting to hold a People's Vote, but on the questions to be asked. At that point the coalition could fracture between options for either a variety of 2-option votes or a 3 option vote (remain, renegotiate or no deal). There'd be all sorts of tensions over who gets to be in power, who gets to renegotiate the deal. All the while you'd have internal party turmoil inside the Tories and likely Labour too. Plus there'd actually need to be someone in charge negotiating terms of an extension with the EUThe path from Theresa May's deal failing in Parliament to a People's Vote being authorised would require extraordinary levels of cross-party cooperation, compromise on deeply-held ideology and suspension of personal and party political ambitions. That's not to say it's not possible, I just think you're massively underestimating the potential for failure here.

The question here (if there is one and if people are actually capable of thinking which I dont believe they are anymore) is ""should the UK increase it's national debt further or not?"" My position is that it should not as the cost of the current debt is already impacting the ability of the economy to grow. I believe that income tax should be increased by 1p (for all bands) to pay off the debt and increase NHS spend. What I am very keen not to happen is for any government to increase the debt further so that the country gets trapped in a debt cycle that it can never address.

117077,10,cretter,"A spiv, basically. Nigel cleverly tapped into an opportunity to harvest EU allowances and a nice pension. Due to the UK's banana republic electoral system there was never any possibility of the party making any parliamentary headway despite significant support from elderly disgruntled Tories who believed David Cameron (an admirer of Blairism) was not sufficiently right wing enough.The answer was to tap into the EU parliament and gain not only financially, but free from any scrutiny of the UK print media, get away with doing very little for the money. To maximise exposure, Nigel picked his moments to grandstand in Brussels. Usually this involved insulting heads of the Commission using language 'you lot' , 'non country', ' low grade bank clerk' that his xenophobic supporters back in Blighty cannot get enough of.Where the plan went wrong was the referendum result. At no point did Nigel expect to 'win'. You can see it from the shock on their faces after the result came through. Because it meant they now had to make good on their lies and worse still, leave the source of party funds, which is now in the multi millions because non members have no commissioner and no MEPs. This explains why months later he suddenly called for another referendum knowing full well people would vote to remain but pretending the victory margin this time would be even larger.One day, somebody will investigate what happened to all the funds the Dads Army party received from Brussels and will trace where it all went. Interestingly, I live in the Caribbean most of the year. If you want to hide money offshore then this is the place.

117092,10,ByGollie,"Previously posted by /u/ScarletIT in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/brexit/comments/9z1v47/why_cant_the_uk_get_a_canada_agreement_with_the_eu/ea6h4oz/)There are a lot of things that Brexiters are missing and that they cannot really grasp so I will try to point out at a few things.1) It is the EU's job to make the EU's interestsThere is no reason for the EU to engage in charity with the UK. Mind you this does not mean antagonize the UK, but it means that the EU is not taking risks or weakening itself to serve the UK's needs. The UK needs stopped being the EU needs the moment you voted to leave. Now of course the EU is more than willing to cater to the UK if there is a exchange of favors, if the UK is willing to offer the EU something the EU wants in exchange for what they want, but they have no reason to do that for free.2) The UK has very little to offer to the EU.This is something the brexiters and empire nostalgic have the hardest time understanding. The UK reacts as if Brexit is going to be the downfall of the EU. As if the brexit fee is what separates the EU from impending bankruptcy As if the UK withdrawal would take away irreplaceable resources from the EU. and ... well.. none of that is true. As a matter of fact Brexit is such little concern to the EU that while it has taken centerstage in every political discussion in the UK, in EU most people don't even know if it happened already or not. The truth is the EU is way more ready for the No deal brexit that the UK constantly invokes as a threat. As a matter of fact the EU is operating on the not unfounded assumption that the UK is not reliable enough to be trusted to come with a workable deal before the bitter end.3) A UK - EU deal has to exist in the context of international deals.The UK operates as if the deal between the UK and the EU exists in a universe apart from every other deal. Yet it has always been the political stance of the EU to have specific rules and specific demands to the entire world and operate their deals based on how much those countries they align to them. The Canada Deal, the Norway Deal, every other Deal are about a third party nation operating within the boundaries or the EU framework of freedoms and rights. That is the way a colossal market that unites 27 countries works. To change the terms for the UK is not an isolated affair. is to announce to the rest of the world that more is available for those conditions. The UK operates as both the deal with the UK will be a private matter and the UK is a better partner to the EU than literally the entire rest of the world and it is wrong in both accounts.4) ExceptionalismThe UK continues to operate as if their country was a special case and different from any other country to deal with the EU. The unfortunate part is, this is true but in a negative way. the UK possesses overseas territories that have very problematic implications that were somewhat dampened by their membership in the EU but are going to become a serious issue as they exit. Most notably Northern Ireland and Gibraltar. They have always been an issue before, but being in a single market and under an umbrella of common regulation that helped defusing the issue, after all they can be nominally in a different country but still under the umbrella of the EU. Now the UK is in the position where if Ireland or Spain decide they want to let Brexit die on the hill of their contested territory they can just do that. That means not only that like explained in the points before there are no reasons for the EU to give the UK a better deal than everyone else, but there are pretty good reasons to not even concede to the UK the same terms they would concede to a different Third party country.5) Overplaying their handGiven the situation the UK should really take any offer the EU is willing to throw their way and say thank you, and the EU has been so far EXTREMELY generous with the conditions they offered. Yet the UK has constantly refused to accept the EU offers expecting more. There is no scenario in which the UK gets more. And worse the UK is constantly overplaying their power in this negotiation. as said above the constant threat of an Hard brexit is the most obvious example since the UK will be devastated by a no deal while the EU would be mildly inconvenienced and is preparing for it anyway. Even worse, this overplaying is causing the position of the UK to become worse as we speak with their economic services abandoning the island for europe.",eag1537,a0adlu,a0adlu,9.07E-13,-1,Against,25-11-18

117095,10,Heisenberg_B_Damned,"You're missing the point. The debt is utterly irrelevant in itself. The debt as a percentage of GDP is all that matters. Austerity slows down GDP growth and is counterproductive. Well counterproductive at clearing the debt but it also stops money circulating amongst the less well off and filters money upwards to the wealthy.If they'd stuck with Gordon Browns use of quantitative easing (which I don't agree with but at least it's better than austerity) then we wouldn't have gone back into recession. That double dip recession (there's no such thing BTW) was actually George applying austerity and it immediately dumping us back into recession.In the event of a recession (or even poor growth) the correct economic thing to do is create more money and bolster the economy. I haven't had chance to evaluate what happened in Venezuela but I'd bet they took a hit from lower oil prices and then stopped government spending on internal national projects and moved to buying in goods from external markets. Printing money and sending out of the economy that prints it is the problem.That will cause the kind of debt cycle that you're worried about.It's what happened in Weimar republic (Keynes, amongst others, predicted the Treaty of Versailles would be disastrous). War reparations meant they were printing new money and then sending it to other countries. The currency devalued, they had to print more (which left the economy again) and so the spiral went. Utterly predictable and probably deliberate and punitive.It's what happened in Zimbabwe. Printed money which got stuffed in offshore account of corrupt officials.Printing money and using it within the economy that prints it is fine. It'll bolster GDP growth and always outgrows any debt caused. It does mean the extremely wealthy will own a slightly lower percentage of the overall currency though which is why they go to great lengths to spread fear that printing money will automatically cause a death spiral. It simply won't.There was a video on Reddit the other day of Philip Hammond admitting as much. He basically said the way to get out of recession is to grow the economy. He's right but that isn't what he or George have been doing.",eag2qmo,eafvcrh,a075ol,0.959749435,0.919498871,Brexit,25-11-18

117139,10,TheeCaptainee,"Firstly, brilliant. I almost dont care what opinion people come to as long as they have thought about it and you appear to have done - my apologies are therefore in order.Secondly, I have also looked at the information around spending cuts and recession. I agree, it is not a good move to drastically cut spending in a recession as this only amplifies things. I am sure you would also agree that dramatically increasing spending could also have some negative results and so our discussion is a much more reasonable one around 'how much' spending and 'where is best' - all of which is good.Having said all that, there is a time when a government needs to stop increasing debt. In this instance it appears the conservative government inherited a budget spend greater than the tax revenue. (thus a deficit). They then tried to cut the spend back to match tax revenue at which point they are accused by the left wing (high and low) of being evil and implementing austerity. The problem with this is that in the minds of the people they are being 'held back' by an evil government not spending on A or B. However, the government is simply trying to stop the debt increasing. Then what happens is the Labour government comes to power and starts to spend money to the delight of the left wing. This whole situation is rather shabby. It is simply playing politics with the people rather than supporting them. As a centrist I am deeply upset by the rhetoric of either side which propagates this situation. &amp;#x200B;",eagesif,eagb8wh,a075ol,0.873400876,0.746801753,Brexit,25-11-18

117159,10,Heisenberg_B_Damned,"Well like I said Machiavelli had a point about pantomime politics.Trying to cut spending to get out of debt works great at a personal level, this is how most of us think of being fiscally responsible.Trying to cut spending to get out of debt at the scale of a country is disastrous because the tax take (the countries equivalent of a wage) is directly related to how much money is pumped into the economy from different sectors. The government spending makes up a number of those sectors (health, education, law enforcement, local council facilities and so on - for the UK at least). So cutting spending is, at best, stupid.As I've repeatedly said the only relevant measure is debt as a % of GDP. Austerity cuts growth of GDP and is far worse at recovery than growing GDP by spending. Austerity also only helps the already rich. It's the exact opposite of fiscal responsibility for the vast majority of the country.Think of it this way. You're in debt, you owe more money monthly than you make but because you have your own bank in your house and your own currency and you use Fiat money you simply create more money to make your wage higher than the debt.This money now circulates round your house keeping your wage at the same higher level each month because cash is a flow not a single use item.Economics is complex and you should never ever listen to anyone comparing a countries economy to a household one. At the very best they're uninformed and if they have access to economic advisers then they're downright mendacious and possibly even evil, as you keep saying.",eagixae,eagesif,a075ol,0.867798802,0.735597603,Brexit,25-11-18

He promptly came back empty handed and defeated.  As famously once said by a certain ~~Mr Drunker~~ Juncker. ""There can be no choice on the democratic treaties "" . Subsequently , the question about EU membership that had been kicked down the road by previous governments ( such as Labour) was finally asked.To the shock of the establishment, the losers of globalism, you know the working class people who don't seem to get the benefits of extreme open borders and having to compete for jobs and homes tipped the scale , came out and said no. I believe the proportion was 30% Labour voters and 70% conservatives voted leave and indeed a considerable number of Scots, a near million or so. The margin between leave and remain.Come 2018 (as predicted) we approach the deadline with a potential constitutional and political crisis all thanks to Poundland Thatcher. People say she is weak, is she? Or is she simply doing what her EU overlords want her to do. To the left's delight ( Labour, SNP, Sinn Feinn and Lib dems) ,she has sacrificed the necon conservative party at the EU alter. She has put forth a bad deal, which will be voted against.

117251,10,lordfnord23,"Der Spiegel: Brexit = Best of both worlds (for the EU) **The EU has approved the resignation agreement with Great Britain - and for the first time adopted a member. Brussels has almost completely prevailed, but the British are now facing a test.**Angela Merkel did not talk for long, her feelings on this Sunday afternoon his ""ambivalent"". On the one hand, according to the German Chancellor, she was ""sad"" because the withdrawal of the British is now becoming reality. On the other hand, she was also ""relieved"" that the withdrawal agreement had come this far.""Merkel's emotion is likely to be the most extreme that could be felt on the side of the remaining 27 EU members at the special EU summit on Brexit on Sunday. The first big step in Britain's adoption of the EU was almost like a cold administrative act, a bureaucratic formality. It took the 27 heads of state and government a full 24 minutes to approve the resignation treaty. The political declaration on future relations with Great Britain was also adopted a few minutes later, including thanks to EU negotiator Michel Barnier.Only then was British Prime Minister Theresa May taken to the meeting room in the Brussels Council building to address her colleagues. She already acted like a representative of a third country.**EU has achieved its goals**""Of course it's a separation,"" Merkel says after the meeting. ""In the future, it will be relations between the EU and a third country."" The future settlement of disputes, the end of freedom of movement, the threat of a dispute over fishing rights - Merkel has all sorts of points where the British and the rest of the EU will go their separate ways in the future and, above all, where there could still be trouble.With the almost 600-page withdrawal treaty, there is now a blueprint for withdrawal from the EU, but not much has been said about future relations. The Union has already achieved one of its most important goals: it has shown that leaving the Community is no more pleasant. The prediction by EU sceptics that Brexit would encourage other countries to leave has not materialised. On the contrary, the talk about Frexit, Nexit and Czexit fell silent just as quickly as it became clear that the withdrawal would have painful or even catastrophic consequences.The EU can also be satisfied in other respects:- It has demonstrated its unity to London - ""a good experience,"" Merkel said.- The EU has protected the internal market and prevented Britain from picking the raisins out of membership.- It has ensured that there is no new hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.""It's a diplomatic feat,"" says Merkel. ""A resignation agreement that takes mutual interests into account and gives a glimpse into the future"".During the transition phase after its withdrawal - at least until the end of 2020, but probably longer - Britain will remain a quasi member of the EU, without being allowed to have a say. And should the negotiations on a free trade agreement fail, which is by no means out of the question, the exit agreement would mean that the fall-back solution for Ireland would take effect. Then the whole of Great Britain would have to stay in the EU customs union and would not be allowed to leave it again without the Brussels placet.**Juncker: ""This is a tragedy""**All this, of course, only applies if the resignation agreement gets a majority in the British parliament in December. EU representatives are therefore obviously trying to avoid winning poses in order not to supply the Brexit hardliners with any more ammunition. This is a sad moment, this is a tragedy,"" said EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Council President Donald Tusk gave the whole thing a melodramatic touch by quoting a Queen song: ""Friends will be friends, right till the end"".Only Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who last spent days in London and Brussels holding his breath with the drama about Gibraltar, danced out of line again: ""We all lose through the Brexit"", he said, ""but Spain wins at Gibraltar"".May immediately rejected that. Of course, the British government will continue to represent overseas territory in the future. ""I am proud that Gibraltar is British,"" May said after the summit. Their fight for the agreement has already begun. The deal gives Britain back control of its borders and legislation and puts an end to free immigration from the EU, May said. It is in the ""national interest"" for Parliament to approve the agreement. Is she as sad as Merkel to leave the EU? ""No,"" May replied after a short hesitation.**Now the EU gets the ""best of both worlds"".**How different David Cameron sounded when he wrested concessions from the EU in February 2016, shortly before the Brexit referendum. Britain is getting ""the best of both worlds,"" Cameron boasted. It will continue to enjoy all the benefits, such as access to the EU's internal market, but can prevent things like a European army.Now, however, the EU is likely to have further access to the British market, possibly collect British membership fees for years to come - and it can grow together politically without being slowed down by London.The best of both worlds.auto translated with deepl",NA,NA,a0bnq0,0.28695766,-0.42608468,Against,25-11-18
