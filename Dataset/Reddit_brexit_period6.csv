What the EU has is a committee which never works: ""a camel is a horse made by committee"".Shackles are broken as with a smaller committee you can be more agile and quicker to make decisions without having to have everyone compromise and no one satisfied.This is fairly draining, I will try to answer more of your points when I have more energy...:/",dfkvesz,dfksk8t,61zr8o,0.873469856,0.746939712,Brexit,30-03-17

16485,6,SBHB,"Answers to some of your questions: 1. Le Pen probably won't win the French election. But if they do and France votes out of the EU then the EU is finished. France and Germany are essentially the lynch pins of the European Union, if either leaves I imagine the union would collapse pretty soon.2. I also think it's unlikely Scotland will leave the UK, I say this because of the number of SNP supporters who voted to leave the EU (around 1/3). I think the state of Scottish finances (largely in such poor shape because of the decline of oil prices) also reduces the chances of a Scottish secession. If it does leave then Britain is no longer Britain. Scotland would largely be in the dark, probably even more so than the UK, as it would find itself outside of both the UK and the EU and would have to apply for EU membership. It might take time for Scotland to rejoin the EU as an independent nation but this is possible providing they reduce their budget deficit to below 3% which is required to enter the EU (it's currently around 9%). This might be unpopular as it would require either large rises in taxation or cuts in public spending.3. Some elements of British society want to see a collapse of the EU. However, most in the British government don't as the EU provides stability on the continent. 4. For the most part Britain voted to leaveâ€‹ the EU over fears of immigration as well as losing British sovereignty. ",dfl25ri,628100,628100,0.022314875,-0.955370249,Against,30-03-17
16486,6,HorseBackMongol,"thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.So far we have seen the individualist Nationalist parties win in two of three elections (wins with Brexit, Trump; loss in the Netherlands election).Certainly I am not in France, so I have an outsider's view, but I've been hearing on BBC programs that air in America that Le Pen could pull off a victory. I admit my confusion about understanding your answer. Isn't it because Scotland voted to **remain** that they want a second referendum to attempt to leave the UK so they can apply for EU membership? ""They want to get out, so they can get back in.""I did not know about the state of Scotland's budget, or the budget deficit requirements for EU membership. Interesting! And certainly a potential barrier to passing Scottish Independence.Why would certain segments of the British public want the EU to collapse? Don't they see its existence as strengthening and increasing safety in Europe?To the best of your knowledge--or, anyone's knowledge--did any of the British politicians who advocated for 'Leave', want the EU to continue its mission? That would seem completely backwards, but I could see a scenario in which a British politician wants the benefits of a combined Europe (safety, cooperation, trading advantages, etc), without having to actually pay for any of it. Or, ""We'll take the benefits, but we won't lift a finger to help.""It would seem that no matter who you are in Britain--member of the public, or politician--the presence of the EU is a good thing for them. By voting to leave, they have struck the first major blow to its foundation.",dfl37wq,dfl25ri,628100,0.043258188,-0.913483625,Against,30-03-17

16488,6,TBFProgrammer,"If the presence of a national election were really so disruptive to the EU's diplomacy, it would be impossible for the EU to manage to negotiate anything with any foreign government. The elections will not prevent negotiations from taking place, unless the EU thinks it's hand is so strong it can simply force the UK to bow to its demands.Instead, the UK couldn't have asked for a better window. By forcing France and Germany to negotiate from an election-preceding split-brain, it gains additional leverage. After all, should the EU countries take the risky hard-line position, they face the potential of their electoral challengers seizing on this as ammunition.France is thus forced to set weak anchor points in the opening. Germany's election weakens haggling, as the details begin to be hammered out. Finally, any crises from Italy would mean that the UK would at least do well, if not outright win, on the final points where no mutual agreement can be reached and one side must concede to the other.",dfl5jqm,6269xd,6269xd,0.988959671,0.977919342,Brexit,30-03-17

16491,6,amgiecorker,"Hiya.  not an expert, but here's some thoughts.  I don't think many rational people want the EU to collapse.  Demographics show the more educated and 'successful' half of the UK would rather remain.  And the EU makes up half our export market so we are intertwined. The Tory politicians in the UK would like to have their cake and eat it; i.e. the EU stays a good free trade export market for us, but we also get to setup our own trade agreements with other parts of the world.  So most politicians would want the EU to continue; a few extremist fruit cake politicians exist, but they are minority. Some of the population justify leaving because EU will collapse.  I think there's a psychological defence mechanisms in play (i.e. someone suspect their vote to leave was indeed silly, so they project ""well the EU is finished anyway"" because that makes them feel better). Some parts of the press have also carried a lot of anti-EU stories, not always supported by facts - apparently for decades. here's some examples: https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/23/10-best-euro-myths-from-custard-creams-to-condoms.  The relationship between politicians and our right wing tabloids in particular, is very unhealthy in the UK, so there's an argument that this Brexit has been manufactured, over many years, through these channels.  There is some perception among more thoughtful leave voters that the EU is carrying too many passengers (failing economies); for a liberal certainly, and for many economists, the benefits of membership outweigh any concerns in this regard though.  EU hasn't recovered from recession as well as the US did; would be vulnerable to more downturn; but I heard recently GDP started growing again. I think the pain that the UK is in for will make other EU countries (citizens) more wary of voting leave in referendums - we are blazing a rather odd trail and will generate cautionary facts which can be used to dissuade leavers.  Though some EU fruit cakes politicians will be encouraged more to try to leave, their opponents will be better informed on how to combat their tactics.  Brexit has a very weak mandate in the UK (population split 50/50, with unelected leader forcing changes through and many of the leavers being mis-led; the case for brexit will weaken as reality kicks in; the EU seem to be saying article 50 is reversible (if democracy required it) and a lot of credible, significant political figures support remain - if the Tories kept pushing hard brexit, they would fail (absolutely destroying the economy just before an election): they've softened a bit but they may well still fail) so its not clear yet if it will actually happen.  If it does happen, we will know more about the impacts in about 5 years (what the exit deal looks like - some say will take longer, but the EU are suggesting 5 year cut off, a two year deal seems unlikely unless we go WTO tariffs which UK business on the whole, doesn't like, but might give the Tories time to paper over cracks before an election - or might cause meltdown - they are taking large risks) and then 10 years-ish (whether there were benefits overall - a lot of metrics would have to be balanced to understand the impact)The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com), and the Financial Times are good fact based UK newspapers (if you want to keep monitoring).  BBC has an obligation to report all sides, which some said made it weak during referendum (because it gave air time to drivel), but has been tougher on the drivel mongers recently, which bodes well (it remains a national treasure IMO).  SBHB's good post strengthens my general impression; Scotland leaving UK is currently unlikely.disclaimer: I voted remain, but I try to base arguments on facts.

There is some speculation that Le Pen will win the French elections but it is worth noting that Le Pen will be running most likely against a moderate who will likely attract support from the left and the middle-ground. 2. Yes the reason the SNP want to leave the UK is because of the high remain vote in Scotland. However, a lot of the people who voted remain will still want to stay in the UK even if it leaves the EU e.g some Labour and most Conservative voters in Scotland. On the other hand around 30-35% of SNP voters (who are pro-independence, especially from the EU! Most SNP supporters are pro-EU however) also voted to leave the EU, these people are very anti-EU and would most likely vote to remain in the UK out of fear that if Scotland left the UK it would then re-join the EU. So the support for independence has risen slightly but not massively.3. They want the EU to collapse because they hate the idea of a European super-state.

This matter has been explained many times, including during the article 50 statement the other day. A soft Brexit was hinted at early on, but the EU has repeatedly stated that the UK cannot cherry pick a free market without taking freedom of movement. This will not satisfy the people who want to leave, so we'd be back where we started, with Eurosceptics dominating British politics until we do it again properly. Given that Gina Miller has forced the UK to reveal way more of its intentions ahead of the negotiations than the EU has, they were forced to declare an intention ahead of time to pursue a hard Brexit. Our negotiating position isn't strong enough to insist on common market access alone (which incidentally is all we signed up for in the first place). The ""no deal"" declaration was brought about by the same circumstances, and is necessary because Article 50 was designed to discourage countries from leaving - the timescale is too short and if no agreement is made within it then the country is ejected with 'no deal'. This means brinkmanship might rule - with the EU holding out for a bad deal for the UK because it is the stronger side and can cope with it better. The UK had no choice but to say it'll take no deal over a bad deal. It's establishing how the negotiations should play out.But according to this guy this ""really amounted to the Prime Minister putting a gun to her head and threatening to shoot. As a negotiating ploy, it failed miserably."".

The banking crisis was worldwide, not EU-specific, and the UK has failed to deal with it due to the actions of the Conservative government/coalition. Sure, some countries in the EU, such as Greece, have been far worse off than others, but these systems always come with a bell curve. Here is an article briefly explaining that Greece lied through its teeth to join the EU and then, through the decisions of Greece's own government, went on a spending spree and fucked its own economy up. Greece's fault, not the EU's. The UK had the advantage of having the potential, as a highly developed nation, to be at the better end of the above mentioned bell curve.

They are denying the right to simultaneous trade discussions while the exit discussions are ongoing. This steals UK and European sovereignty and is building resentment. That resentment has been expressed by the UK via a statement linking cooperation on security with favourable negotiations. This would be disastrous for the EU as denying simultaneous discussions is disastrous for the UK. If the EU maintains its stance it seems obvious the UK should immediately cease payments to Brussels and refuse to pay any divorce bill. Why should the UK pay if the EU makes plain its intention to vindictively damage the UK post Brexit? The EU is doing this to rule other nations through fear and prevent further ExitsThey keep telling us the reason the EU exists is primarily for the peace and stability of Europe.

Essentially the non-racist pro-Brexit argument is that we can stand and face the world on our own merit - sink or swim - can we generate more economic activity outside or inside the EU, and can we still if we lose a lot of trade with the EU due to hard Brexit (WTO)? I think for the UK the answer to that question is yes but it might take longer than people expect.

16674,6,RidingRedHare,"Grexit also would have been disastrous for Greece. Their budget deficit was 15% of GDP. Greece's horrendous national debt would not have gone away by leaving the Euro. Greece was f*cked no matter what.Countries cannot file for bankruptcy. Their debt does not go away just because they stop paying. A country's debt goes away only if debt holders agree to a restructuring. And it is not possible to force foreign debt holders to such a restructuring. See also under Republic of Argentina v. NML Capital, Ltd.After Grexit, Greece would have still owed their creditors more than 300 billion Euros. Greece still would have had that disastrous budget deficit of almost half their government expenses.And if Greece would have stopped paying, Greece's banks would have gone bankrupt immediately, as those were holding the majority of Greece's bonds. That's very different to Argentina. Argentina's situation improved after debt restructuring because Argentina was not running a primary budget deficit at the time.  Greece main problem was and is the inability to collect taxes, combined with lack of audits and high levels of government corruption. In Greece, a self employed taxpayer can make 50k a year, file a tax report claiming they made only 10k a year, thus pay no income tax at all due to low income, with no real criminal penalties for the tax fraud, and relatively little risk of ever having to pay tax on that other 40k. Greece has a swimming pool tax. Back in 2010, satellite pictures of Athens showed 16,794 swimming pools. But only 324 swimming pools had been reported by the locals to the Greek tax authority.Meanwhile, those professions with a high tax fraud rate (lawyers, medicine, engineering, education, and media) still make up Greece's parliament.

So should the EU have overruled a long standing territorial claim from one of its loyal remaining member states? In order not appease a member state that has snubbed them repeatedly and is now leaving the club, leaving a royal mess behind?That's just another example of UK being surprised that other countries actually have pride and interests too.It's hypocritcal, too. UK can't bear to be ruled over by 'Brussels', but apparently they take it as a given that the EU (the other 26) will tell Spain what to think and say on the Gibraltar issue.Btw - the EU can't even override Spain formally - they have a veto. All the EU could muster is the power of persuasion and pressure Spain to give in. They might do that. But after this unhinged display by the Tories - they certainly haven't become more motivated to do so.Factor in that the opening of the Spanish-Gibraltar border was actually imposed on Spain in the early 80ies, when Spain joined the EU. The EU, with the UK as its member, was in a position to pressure Spain into that at time - because Spain wanted to join the club. I haven't heard anybody in the UK say, that UK interests in Gibraltar at the time were somehow a 'national' issue that shouldn't have been part of the Spanish accession negotiations.Now the boot is on the other foot. The UK is requesting a whole new type of free trade treaty with the EU, a new kind of special relationship, crafted especially to their wishes. Fine, such a treaty may be negotiated. But it does not apply *automatically* to Gibraltar, but only after an agreement between the UK and Spain.This is now on the draft common negotiation position. There is no reason, why specific interests on member states could not be adopted by all the 27 member states, as a whole.Btw, nowhere is a mention of the word sovereignty in EU position.  The idea that anybody might go to war over Gibraltar certainly hasn't been uttered by anyone on the continent. That's fully on Michael Howard and English right-wing press, who are already comparing the size of navies - seems like they are looking forward to a war, almost. I find it very unsettling.The way I see it, btw, the claim that Spain has over Gibraltar is just as legitimate as the British one. The UK may claim 300 years of sovereignty over the territory and a treaty from 1700. Spain can counter that the treaty was signed under duress at the time (the UK just took Gibraltar and forced Spain to sign the treaty). And that the area is attached to their land mass. And as pointed out before, if the French had taken a part of England by force in 1700, forced the UK to sign it over, the UK would sure as hell still be trying to recover it today. And they would not take kindly to the EU telling them to drop the claim.",dfs66d2,dfq6ede,62zcu9,0.616898817,0.233797634,Neutral,03-04-17

On mass, these people naturally prefer to stick with language and culture they are most familiar with, particularly if the native culture is so different, and so tolerant (as western culture relatively is), making it easy to reject.

It would also would imply the UK government retains a lot of rights that the EU shouldn't want to if the agreement maintain UK standing in that court.

If you have useful skills and can get a well paid job things would be easier, but it sounds like you're looking for unskilled work. There's plenty of unskilled work to find, but rents are high in London and that's a precarious situation to be in, with or without brexit. So my advice is to keep things as low risk as possible. Which means staying in hostels and trying to find a job as soon possible. You probably won't be able to afford much more than a room in a shared flat, and you'll be spending quite a bit of your money on food and transportation. Once you have a more stable job you can settle down more. The biggest risk for newcomers is renting a flat and being stung later on.

Parliament has decided, the Bill has passed through Parliament and the only remaining issue is the Royal Assent for Article 50 to be invoked leading to the eventual exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, better known as Brexit. The elephant in the room has now firmly stepped into the forefront and it is important to take a look at how this will impact on individuals, businesses, and property owners in the South London part of the greater conurbation.A time of uncertainty is bound to follow, to some extent this has already taken root and it is likely to gain traction as the negotiations continue aided and abetted by the media. Now that Article 50 has been invoked the (political) games will begin in earnest.House prices rose faster in recent months with high-end property in the vanguard as London property values made considerable gains. For individuals, and investors alike, it would appear that property values will continue to rise, by what degree is open for conjecture. Whilst the pros and cons of our withdrawal are negotiated there may be a slowdown in terms of overall growth and already we have seen the pound devalued, yes it was pre-planned anyway, and collectively the burden on family budgets is likely to be considerable. With interest rates at an all-time low people are still buying property regardless of any perceived lack in confidence.It is anticipated that the Capitalâ€™s Housing Market will be hit hardest by any adverse impact from Brexit, much will depend on the likely outcome of negotiations with regard to the Financial Sector which currently, and historically, does much to reinforce the demand for high value property in the City.Whilst it is true that existing property owners in the City will be able to maximise their return by selling, they will then have to buy new property at no small cost. The general inflationary spiral also makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for new buyers to get on the property ladder. Increased house prices have propped up consumer activity, and consumption is the backbone of the National economy, at a time when wage rises have been more moderate. It is also a fact worthy of note that a substantial amount of property purchases are investment based for the rental market, further limiting the availability of affordable housing for purchase.South London will continue to see large scale property rises, bricks and mortar are solid investments in times of uncertainty. Whilst Brexit negotiations rumble on over the next two years we can confidently expect to see high-value property being an attraction to movers and shakers domestically and internationally as the City of London takes its place on the International scene. Simultaneously, we can expect affordable housing suburbs to move further out of the City causing a greater pressure and the need for good public transport infrastructure. The die is cast and we will watch with interest.https://www.alexneil.com/blogarticles.php?id=1802991",NA,NA,64jimn,1.14E-10,-1,Against,10-04-17
17189,6,znk3r,"Why should I stay? Can someone give me arguments to stay in UK as an EU citizen?I came more than 5 years ago for job reasons, and I have been in London since then. Working quite happily as a software engineer for a big international company (no idea if the company will remain or move to EU territory).I have been writing a list of reasons to stay and to leave. As everyone else I may wait until the future is a little more clear, but every month I strike more things from one list and add the opposite one. Some of them may happen, some of them not.So, my question is for EU residents who plan to stay, or for UK residents who would prefer for EU nationals to stay (high specialised people, who bring value to UK, pay their taxes and at the same time NHS, pensions and benefits for UK citizens).In the reasons for leave I have:* The weather is wonderful.. during one week, per year.. if you are lucky.* Which brings the spiders and the mould.. everywhere.* In London, everything seems to be 1 hour away of bus/tube/train, if you are lucky. Meaning everything feels far, and you end wasting too much time just moving around.* It's hard and expensive to buy quality vegetables, fruit and meat. And if UK gets a bad trade agreement, I fear that will become even worse (North-Africa vegs and fruit are usually tasteless, and not of great quality, same for South-America, specially after being frozen for weeks on sea travel)* Prices are going to rise, and my salary/pension are going to lose value.* Fear of tories ruining social community values (screw your employment rights, screw climate change and nature protection laws, screw your privacy rights, screw minimal QA for sold products, privatize all the things .. we need trade agreements and we'll accept the TTIP with the eyes closed)* Since I arrived the health system has gotten worst. Haven't need it myself, but I want it to be decent if I needed it for something.* If I want to stay I may need to go through a long process to get permanent residency or, even worse, a visa point system. I'm lazy and my free time is too valuable to go with all that crap, and still makes me feel like I'm not wanted here (which nobody has told me yet to the face, but feels real)* Bringing the suitcase full of home food (things you can't find here.. or can't find without expending half your salary) has been a long xmas tradition for many expats, which is going to become a nightmare if there's a hard border control in the middle.* Your parents may need now a passport and a visa for a weekend visit?* Not having the EU sanitary card if you go back home for a week, and having to get a travel insurance.* (there are some more which I can't remember right now)Reasons to stay:* Language. Again, lazy to learn a new language.* Moving your staff to a new flat is funny enough to organise that across countries (sofa, bed, tv, weights and gym equipment.. the stuff I can't carry with me in the plane).* I like my job, and my work pals, and I can't work remotely.* [Edit] The cultural options in London (theater, museums, ..)* [Edit] People's politeness and civility",NA,NA,64k5rh,1.44E-05,-0.999971204,Against,10-04-17

[Wiki link for starters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis)  Personally, I think Greece should be thankfull for being part of the EU, so they could be bailed out with a minimum of costs.  Without the EU, their own government would've had debts up the wazoo for decades to come.  As for the refugee crisis.  You'll note that the EU is actually a driving force to make this a GENERAL problem, rather than a NATIONAL problem.  Without the EU, Greece would've had to fend for itself.  At least with the EU they can discuss the topic, and receive aid.  Leading to the refugee resettlement program, spreading them to different nations.  (although apparently not very effective at this point.)   Obviously not all nations are like minded on the topic.  Germany is a strong believer in accepting migrants.  Other countries are not.  I think you can fairly place Britain, with Brexit, in the camp that is not willing to think of helping refugees.  Already there are strong talks of limiting immigration, even for 'productive' citizens.  The EU is not some super awesome institute.  it's still the collection of it's member states with their own viewpoints.  But at least it allows for the cooperation on important matters like national debts and refugee crisis.  Without the EU none of that would've happened.  I never understand the blame game.  Are you honestly trying to say that Britain by itself would've handled these topics better than the EU?  You would've bailed out Greece?  You would've done more for the refugee crisis?  I can say with a 100% certainty that neither would've happened.  ",dg43pve,dg4344a,64pmuh,0.999777155,0.999554311,Brexit,11-04-17

Its definitely a cost of leaving, or if you like, it reduces the 'benefits' of leaving.  Which 'benefits' will be more than wiped out by economic impact as below.   (i.e. There's definitely a better case for staying, economically, over the next 5-10 years; after that it's a gamble as to whether we start recovering our losses basically depending on low regulation attracting more business or on a miracle whereby the EU stupidly let us have a deal that lets non EU get access to EU through us at less cost than if they dealt direct with the EU).  I have to say I'm not an economist, but that's my understanding from evidence, which compliments my rational expectation (stress an economy, it performs less well; and we're not going to get charity trade agreements from anyone).  Corbyn's approach is I think more ideological than rational (as bla5er mentions).

The longer we leave it, the more painful it will be, the more bitter the negotiations will be, and the worse our relationship with the EU would end up being. I'm as surprised as you are that we voted to leave at this point.

I've thought the UKs departure has been inevitable since the early 2000s as the rest of the EU draws ever closer and we've been showing no signs of following them, but I thought it would have taken longer like you and that article describe, and thus been even more painful.

17426,6,Lejeune_Dirichelet,"I don't see that ever happening. First, after the last EFTA ministerial conference, it was stated that the current EFTA members probably wouldn't accept the UK as an equal member (because of the massive size difference), hinting to the possibility of a custom deal (I'm guessing akin to the FIN-EFTA agreement of old), whose outline is yet to be clarified. But if either Norway, Switzerland, Iceland or Liechtenstein, all countries outside the EU, is not happy and chooses to veto the UK from the EFTA, there's absolutely nothing the EU can do about it (save inventing a new EEA-bis copypasta specifically for the UK - but the EU's pride wouldn't permit it).Second, the EEA is completely ill suited for this situation. It's massive in scope, is supervised by a different court (who, according to it's president, exhibits a different legal thinking than the EU's court of justice), which would make it incredibly clumsy to use as a *temporary* agreement (who, AFAIU, is only intended to be in force for a few years maximum).Furthermore, the EEA+EFTA side of the EEA Agreement is granted a non-binding consultative right to all new relevant EU legislation (something which is not present in Switzerland's Bilateral Agreements). However, all the EEA+EFTA members have to speak with one voice, a clause which was intended to weaken the negotiating position of these countries by promoting infighting between them. Currently Norway is top dog in the sector, which explains much of the reluctance of the country to accept the UK inside. While Norway seems to have shown more willingness recently, this could still prove to be a source of conflict should co-habitation prove too difficult - which is not something that is in the UK's interest if it indeed were to pursue a future as a (regular or special) EFTA member.Lastly, giving up a binding voice in exchange for autonomy in specific areas is acceptable for small countries which wouldn't pull much weight as an EU member anyway, it's not adapted for a country the size of the UK. And it's also certainly not adapted for countries which host such coveted industries such as the City of London. Giving Brussels all rights to regulate the British financial market independently from Westminster would be a very stupid move on the part of the UK, knowing how many in the EU-27 are trying to dislodge as much as they can from it to their own countries.",dg9jspa,65cslh,65cslh,0.386546797,-0.226906405,Neutral,14-04-17

But on the specific case Justin Protts is a contributor on BrexitCentral, which is definitely NOT neutral on the issue.But then on the paper itself it fails to considers certain things.They consider jobs to export on the uk as if they were jobs that exist to serve a specific session of the uk population when they are not.Most jobs that export to the uk export to the rest of the world as well and while, sure, the exports will be impacted by any disturbances of the EU-UK trade is a very rare job the one that is dependent solely on that route.The almost entirety of those jobs will keep going trading internally and with the rest of the trading partners of the EU which it is to say the entire world.Now, while the UK can certainly say the same about its trade the situation is different.The UK, to this day, has no idea what their trade deals will be with the rest of the world, even in the best case scenario, if it gets out of the european single market (like it seems to be doing) they will have to rethink from scratch the trade with the rest of the world, which, do not delude yourself, will not be easy and will not be devoid of problems.Aside from that, even with a UK that totally figured out their future plans, the European union as an economic entity remains the second biggest economy in the world. The trade relationship with europe will make or break the UK just like it would make or break every single country in the world.Now, the idea of complicating trade between the UK and the EU it would be a setback for EU for sure, but not even close the unmitigated disaster that would be fir the UK as for the EU would mean having troubles to negotiate with a roughly 5% slice of the economy while for the UK would mean having the same problem with one third of it.And to add to that the Uk put itself in the position to have to renegotiate all his trade agreements with all the other 2/3 not as part of the other third like he used to be, but as his own tiny slice which will put them at a disadvantage with everyone.So yeah, I seriously doubt that the UK ability to convert the jobs that were dependent on the UK-EU relationship would be on par of the EU ability to do the same with the rest of the world that still have trade agreements intact and the economic power that cannot be ignored or bypassed by anyone on the planet.",dgasyid,dgafrum,65b3sd,7.26E-07,-0.999998548,Against,15-04-17

But here's 3 steps which leave voters in particular should follow in order to speed up awareness (I'm not picking on them; they are the ones who have picked the immensely risky path for the rest of us, so they have more responsibility morally to know what they are doing). (http://manwardpress.com/topics/connections/beating-confirmation-bias-power-changing-mind/)*First, train yourself to understand that what you first believe is not necessarily right or wrong. Itâ€™s likely somewhere in the middle. Embrace that idea and be eager and excited to discover the truth.*Next, as you work to discover the truth, create three distinct hypotheses. Tracking three distinct ideas is important as it forces you to go beyond right or wrongâ€¦ it forces you to explore the gray areas.*Finally, challenge yourself to update your beliefs â€“ and reward yourself when you do. Itâ€™s the hallmark of a finely tuned mind.thinking aloud, seems that Remainers can help by guiding leave voters they know through the above; maybe using the three hypothesis approach in conversations with leave voters (so, on one issue that they feel strongly about (say immigration, or the NHS, whichever they are talking about) encourage them to accept they *might* be wrong first off; then develop 3 hypothesis relevant, and try to name some evidence to support each.  (I've not tried it yet; if anyone wants to develop a simple approach/method, test it, and post it here, please feel free); I might develop some examples when I have time. if attempting the above, we should be well informed, or have an internet connection and a few minutes available: we should also be open to changing our own minds (remain voters) if that's how things pan out on the particular issue being discussed.",NA,NA,65p046,6.47E-06,-0.999987051,Against,16-04-17

17516,6,amcoll,"Here's my rationale for voting leave. The EU has the 4 fundamental rights on which its founded, which are free movement of goods, services, capital and labour. Free movement of goods and services means corporations can move production to other parts of the EU where costs are lower, causing job losses in the UK. Those goods are then transported back to the UK market, resulting in lower prices for the consumer, higher profit margins, or both. Those profits are routed via tax havens to reduce the tax owed to the HMRC because of free movement of capital, resulting in even bigger profitsMeanwhile, those who lost their jobs in the UK face increased competition for jobs from elsewhere in the EU, because of free movement of labour, whilst tax revenues that could provide additional social care schemes are reduced as a result of reduced tax takes. Corporations win at every stage of the processEU citizens from poorer nations benefit from wider job marketsThose Brits at the bottom of the job market lose at every step, bar perhaps lower goods pricesRemoval of any of those 4 rights, or at least a tightening of the rules could bring things back into balance. IMO, free movement of labour should have been a work permit scheme with preferable terms for EU citizens, so governments could throttle the flow of labour to suit the requirements of the economy. So, if we need farm labourers or nurses, restrictions can be relaxed for those job sectors, whilst being tightened for those where we have a surplus of British citizens looking for workFurthermore, Schengen is quite frankly, a disaster. Yes, I get that driving past a ""welcome to Belgium"" sign is a lot easier than any form of border post, but once the outer security perimeter of the EU has been crossed, that's it by way of any meaningful ability to control movements of contraband, illegal migrants etc. Please don't think that this point is made with any form of xenophobia in mind, it is simply meant to illustrate that security should be like an onion, not an egg shell, and even a cursory border crossing might catch something that was missed previously. Who knows, perhaps the next terrorist attack in Europe may have been prevented, had a layered security policy been adopted and the weapons involved caught by a random sniffer dog sweep at the Italian or German border? Certainly, it would have mitigated the scale of the Calais jungle, with migrants being stopped all along the route and subsequently spreading the responsibility of care for those caught across a number of countries, instead of poor France ending up with the lotFinally, the challenges of balancing 27 national interests makes the EU rather unyielding and inflexible when it comes to change. Its also felt to me like decisions were made, based on how they measured up to the broadly left wing ideology of the EU, rather than the reality of a given situation, which may have called for a decision that had even slight right wing undertones. Case in point, Syrian refugees. Once the scale of the refugee numbers was realised, Schengen should have been suspended to prevent the river of refugees headed primarily to Germany and Scandinavia and allowing the EU government to distribute them more evenly across the continent, reducing the burden and maybe preventing the resentment felt by those affected populations, which then led to a rise in REAL right wing sentimentsEdit: Christ almighty, that's some wall of text! :-) Sorry!",dgda1kh,5opueh,5opueh,0.784035294,0.568070589,Brexit,17-04-17

Equality laws are firmly in place in EU and British law, there's ample legal framework in place for women who are discriminated against to take action. We have our second female PM running the country when many western countries have had none. Secondly, yes, we do trade with nations with poor HR records like Saudi, but then, so do all countries. Take for example China. They aren't as bad as many MidEast nations, but they aren't saints either, yet this is often overlooked in discussions such as this. Overall, in terms of human rights, quite a large part of the world have some catching up to do when compared to the EU and UK. Using Saudi as an example seems fairly popular, but it overlooks the fact that the UK and Saudi have historic ties that other EU nations do not, hence why we trade with them. To use a counter argument, Spain has historic ties to Argentina and Chile, both of whom have been serious HR violators in the past 40 years or soFinally, I've yet to see any evidence that there will be a bonfire of human and employee rights, post brexit. In fact, it makes much more sense to assume we will  broadly maintain the same as the EU, so that its easier to cooperate and trade.

As it is Teresa may stands with little populace backing as she was not elected, only coming to power through Cameron's resignation. Winning this election would strengthen her position as prime minister. Secondly this election may be seen as a second opinion on brexit of the nation. He rhetoric leading up to the election will mainly be about brexit. Winning this election with a majority will be seen as a sign of confidence from the population on brexit, giving them stronger mandate to pursue brexit properly.Thirdly, this stronger mandate would potentially have the other parties back down on their opposition to brexit, which is currently a problem in pursuing brexit well. Given that it is happening regardless of if you are pro brexit or pro remain it being done in the best way possible should be a priority. On the other side, if they are to loose this election they likely outcome is a 2 or 3 party government who oppose brexit and may try to reverse the desicion I don't think that the country is 'going to pot' as you say, economic figures and trade measures are currently rather ambiguous as to what the future may hold, so i think its a little early to judge.

Before the coalition government, I quite liked the LDs, and I also very much liked our LD MP (who didn't stand again in 2015, alas).It's going to end up that way, even if it shouldn't.  There are many social issues that need attention, but they're not going to get it while Brexit dominates the headlines.I'm under no illusions over what Brexit could mean but I voted 'leave' as the least worst option.  I draw a distinction between the EU (and especially the ECommission [Ed: I said earlier ECouncil, but I meant the Commission]) on the one hand, which I regard to be irredeemably corrupt and unfit for purpose and, on the other, Europe and its member states as sovereign nations.  I like Europe and our European neigbours, I don't like the EC or what the EU has become.On the contrary, we're now committed to Brexit.  Continued attempts to abort it would make things *less* certain and *more* unstable, where settling into the Art. 50 negotiations will improve (or ameliorate, if you prefer) stability and confidence â€” unless the UK government and the EU 27 all agree that it was all a bad dream and to forget the whole thing.Getting that sort of consensus, I suspect, would be much harder than you might think because there are plenty of EU members (or, rather, individuals within EU member state governments) who do not and never did like the UK because they see us as getting in the way of political unification.  Which is exactly right: I suspect even the most ardent of Europhile British political parties would resist that.  The sane ones would, anyway, because political integration pretty much spells the end of their own political power and the end of each member state's identity, and relegate Westminster to the role of a provincial government.I am quite certain a lot of Europeans feel as strongly about this as I do.Tusk (or Verhofstadt?) may well have been right: common-law and civil-law systems are just too different to integrate, and the UK would never have fit well into a United States of Europe, and our exit was inevitable sooner or later.",dgf41kr,dgf1w3o,662a5n,0.054257443,-0.891485114,Against,18-04-17

17616,6,EddieMcDowall,"I'll take your points in turn if I may.First:Because we're the fifth largest economy in the world and the EU needs us every bit as much as we need them. It's in both groups interests to negotiate a parting that benefits both groups. The alternative will alienate both groups. e.g. if the EU insists on a severance payment we'll have a hard exit. Second:Yes 'some' access to the single market would be nice, but it would be nice for both groups. The EU needs our trade as much as we need theirs.As to the freedom of movement, to me that's a sovereignty issue which for me was the #1 reason for being pro Brexit. Personally I want immigration, we as a nation need it, the NHS depends on it and many other sectors depend on it. We just need to be able to control who we allow in and who we don't. I'm not anti-immigration at all, indeed my wife was born in China and is now British.I'm still hopeful that the UK  government can negotiate a package which will allow some access to the single market in return for some leeway on immigration. I have no problem with that so long as the UK government has the final say on who can (and cannot) come into the UK.However, as I've alluded to, for me sovereignty is absolute. If the EU don't want to play ball I'll happily take a hard Brexit, for I value democracy, I value being able to have a say in the running of my nation without being dictated to by unelected and unnacountable EU commissioners, or being a massive minority in a new European super state.That's the problem with super states, such as the EU is fast becoming and (to a lesser degree the USA and Russia already are). The 'minorities' are huge. 65 million people in the EU is a spit in the ocean (especially when less than 10 million vote) and so their interests aren't a concern.

I would argue that Membership of the Euro was not the PRIMARY cause of the crisis, but rather the culture that encouraged reckless lending to make a quick buck on bundled loan packages. I would argue STRONGLY that, had Spain and Ireland in particular, NOT been part of the Euro they would have experienced VERY similar effects due to a prevalent attitude in the banking sector at the time.  While we can never know for sure, it is likely that outside of the Euro, those countries would not have received the degree of assistance they did, resulting in bank defaults (and in the case of Ireland where bank guarantees were issues, defaulting on national debt.) Don't get me wrong, I certainly concede that euro membership was not all sunflowers and roses, I do feel that much the same would have occurred had the euro not been in place. Ireland, Spain and Italy did not have the political will at the time to prevent it/ take on the bank's bad behavior. ",dgf548r,dgf4c2g,65xj4i,0.127652691,-0.744694619,Against,18-04-17

Can you site the EU allowing the UK to retract article 50? I hadn't come across that and would be interested in the source.2. Of course it aligns with the conservative interest, they wouldn't call an election otherwise. However the suggestion that the interests of a political party and the well being of a nation can't align is tenuous.3. I think Teresa May and a lot of other conservatives (and labour members) do believe brexit is the best way forward for this country, so in their minds furthering the brexit process IS in the national interest.4. About the future economic impacts of brexit. Yes of course the short term is going to be worse off. I don't believe anyone who seriously looked at the leave arguments ever thought that the economic situation would immediately improve. The benefit that serious leavers saw was in the longer term economics. Economic forecasts are a very good resource, however are limited by the scope of information they have access to (i.e. the present) and can't account for large events. In the past they have failed to predict economic crisis and they can't predict the impacts of potential political events 5, 10, 15 years in the future (i.e. Potential trade deals etc). The other factor in this was the potential situation with furthering federalisation of the EU economy, leading to even less economic autonomy than before, and the impending potential failure of the economies of other EU members. A huge amount of money already went toward funding the Greek bail out, and the Italian banking system or the Spanish economy aren't looking too hot right now.5.

17631,6,StrixTechnica,"There are a few of us ;)When I cast my ballot last June, I actually said out loud, ""I'm not proud of what I've just done"".  (The official nearby, of course, said nothing.)  I wish it hadn't come to this, but I don't believe the EC is reformable from within.As I said (and as the linked article indicated), it would require the agreement of the EU 27.  And as I said, that may be difficult because the UK will remain a thorn in the side of EU federalists.I don't take Tusk at his word when he says ""If we have a chance to reverse this negative process, we will find allies"".  Oh, he may personally want that, but Realpolitik is that the matter is way beyond his personal gift even as ECouncil President and that he may simply not be able to pull together sufficient allies.  I don't know if it would require a unanimous vote or a qualified majority and, if the latter, what proportion of agreement would be required.Nothing that any senior politician says should be taken at face value, especially not when both sides are squaring up for negotiations.  There is a lot of posturing going on, and it is very difficult to guess what each side's true intentions are.Take for example the business over residency rights of EU/UK abroad.  This should be a complete no-brainer and in fact I think May actually said that we would be happy to guarantee EU citizens' rights here if that is reciprocated by the EU27.  But they don't want to weaken their hand; nor does May, therefore the status of all concerned remains in limbo.  Does anybody seriously think that residency rights won't be grandfathered?  And yet the matter is nominally on the table for negotiation.Another example is intelligence sharing.  The UK is a member of the ""Five Eyes"" community (UK, US, Canadia, Australia and New Zealand) and thus is privy to much more intelligence than is available to any of the EU27.  *Of course* the EU is fretting about losing access to the good stuff.But it's farcical to suggest that intelligence should not be on the table when the EU is nominally taking such a hard line.  We've got to negotiate with everything we've got.  And that includes, BTW, the willingness to walk away and take WTO terms.  If we are unwilling to do that, then the negotiations are nothing but perfunctory formality and things *really will* go badly for the UK.  Hence May's 'no deal is better than a bad deal'.I think this is far too serious a matter to care in the slightest who laughs or whether we look silly.  One should do what is right, even when it is not popular.That's true, but the EU27 aren't a monolithic block.  In fact, each member state is not a monolithic block.  As I said before, the EU and Europe are quite different animals, and there is a great deal of tension between citizens and businesses of member states, national member state politics and member state EU politics.There are those who want a United States of Europe with a common currency across the union, common fiscal policy and centralised government.  And yet history suggests that excessive centralisation is inefficient and serves its citizens poorly.  What is good for northern Germany is not good for southern Germany.  Ditto Italy.  What is good for Germany isn't automatically good for Italy.  What is good for the periphery member states is not good for the founding members or the UK.Until (and if) political union comes to pass, there will also be national politicians who depend on their citizens' opinions much more than they care about the EC's views.Likewise, member state EU representatives care much more about the EC's views than their own citizens'.German businesses in particular will be hopping mad if we end up on WTO tariffs and end up having to pay 10% on car exports to the UK.  Ditto a lot of other EU business sectors.  The question is how much influence they have, and that very much depends on the extent to which ideology is allowed to drive what goes forward.  I fear that idealistic politics seems much stronger than Realpolitik.Of course it is, it's a strategic move by the Tories to leverage the situation to best advantage.  But don't think for a second that Labour would not do the same.  That's politics.",dgf7uuy,dgf4ouk,662a5n,0.000125777,-0.999748445,Against,18-04-17
17632,6,ee3k,"you are misunderstanding the point I am making, cheap credit WOULD have existed in those countries as the banking secotors in those countries were actively taking part in the dept repacking business. to facilitate this easy credit HAD to be available, and so long as those countries were in the middle of construction booms (and their governments were VERY cosy with the construction industry) cheap credit would have been made available as the boom cannot continue if no-one is buying. Now, as for your point:the reasons Europe resisted QE* for as long as it did was, in effect, printing new money to exclusively buy back government debt from the banks (as the QE polices in the UK and the USA did) amounted to another round of bank bailouts. considering the countries we are referring to, those banks were INCREDIBLY unlikely to reinvest those funds back into the local economy (as they did in the UK/US) in the form of easier credit for new homeowners or businesses, as it would appear as a bad investment.  Ireland or Spain , outside the Euro, would have EXACTLY the same dilemma. it would be both financially unwise and politically dangerous **to be seen** to further protect the banks from their own mistakes while not guaranteeing a return to normal business for companies and potential homeowners. only when Irish, Spanish and Italian bonds were upgraded from Junk status was it finally feasible to attempt QE in Europe, and the same would have been true for those countries outside of the Euro. * If you were simply talking about the government printing more money for general circulation without using it to buy back government debt, that is NOT QE and it is generally seen as a huge red flag that a country is about to implode financially (as in Japan in the 90s, south Africa in the late 00s and most famously Germany in the early 20s) and as such is the most efficient way to get your country's currency dumped on the market and get locked out of the bond markets.",dgf882i,dgf6jfn,65xj4i,0.999748037,0.999496074,Brexit,18-04-17

17648,6,StrixTechnica,"I agree, and of course they will, but regulation of the financial sector is not the same thing as fiscal policy.Fiscal policy is mostly raising revenue via taxation and the bond markets vs public spending (in all areas of government).  Budget deficit/surplus is a direct consequence and function of fiscal policy.The worldwide sovereign debt crisis is as it is because of bad fiscal policy.  Part of it is because of the proverbial race to the bottom and a kind of instance of the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) because countries cut taxation rates to try to maintain a competitive edge.  Taxation rates vary partly because different countries have different expectations of public sector services.The extent to which we have systematic/secular deficit spending (as opposed to contingency deficit spending such as during the aftermath of the financial sector crisis) is an indicator that fiscal policy needs readjustment.  But fiscal policy adjustment is politically very unpopular: somebody's going to lose, either the poor (by way of welfare cuts) or the rich (by way of tax increases) â€” so politicians will avoid addressing secular deficits if they are allowed to get away with it.So far, they have.Same with financial sector regulation, and with similar excuses: proposed tax hikes or increased regulation are met with threats of migration of labour and businesses offshore.  Every time this stand-off has come up, governments back down because doing nothing is easier than actually growing a backbone and doing what's right.  So far, nobody's actually tested to see whether those threats are empty or not.I'm not arguing for austerity, because austerity fiscal policies only make debt:GDP worse (which, irrationally, I would argue, is seen as some measure of an economy's health).  I *am* saying that what we've been doing for the past few decades isn't working, so we need to do something differently (see below for some examples).There is absolutely nothing wrong with 'casino banking' provided it's done with an institution's own money rather than its depositors', and provided that the collapse of investment and speculation branches can't threaten retail and business banking.I agree.Difficult â‰  unpopular.  It's easy to regulate.  It's difficult to regulate wisely.  But, relatively speaking, it's easier to learn from mistakes of the past.The fear is that banks etc will up sticks and move to somewhere purportedly more favourable.  It's not an unreasonable fear, but it's also an example of where what is individually rational for one country is disastrous when everybody does it.  Again, parallels with the tragedy of the commons.Civil servants aren't responsible for making policy.  Politicians are, and we elect politicians based on their policies.  Sure, Whitehall advises on consequences and costs etc, but in the end, they're not responsible for making decisions.How well politicians do their jobs is evident by the results.  I wouldn't say the results of fiscal and monetary policy for the last two or three decades have been even moderately good, would you?That said, Whitehall has an agenda of its own, and it's not necessarily copacetic with that of the government or the electorate that put them there.  Not for nothing was 'Yes, Minister' a popular series, including with politicians.  Thatcher apparently loved it, and even [recorded a sketch with the cast](https://youtu.be/cwaX_DgHZkM?t=46).Sure it's a hard job.  Lots of jobs are.  But when policies prove to be failures, it's time for a re-think.  The globalised economy, of course, makes this much harder and requires much more courage on the part of politicians to make what Sir Humphrey might describe as 'bold' decisions.But there are some fairly straight forward and obvious things that could be done without upsetting too many people but for the political will, beginning with the cost of housing which is the lion's share of most people's income:* Closing the loophole that lets UK real estate be used to launder money (real estate can be owned by overseas companies without listing the beneficial owners of that company even if the foreign jurisdiction does not make that information public, such as tax havens such as the Caymans etc);* putting policies in place to rebalance supply and demand of real-estate, eg taxes on second properties and empty properties;* crack down on unscrupulous and exploitative buy-to-let landlordsâ€ ;* crack down on equity release schemes and endowment mortgages (if they still exist);* building new social housing stockâ€¡; and* do anything possible to keep house price inflation in check so that inflation can bring the house price to salary ratio back to the realms of sanity without putting ordinary people into negative equity.â€  the private rental market is crucial, especially while social housing stock is so poor, but housing benefit is just pouring public money into private hands and isn't sustainable as things are.  There will always be a place for it, but policies could be put in place to make it a less attractive option for poor quality investors.â€¡ yes, this would increase deficit spending but it would also create jobs and there's an important difference between debt acquired with nothing to show for it (eg gambling, holidays) and debt that generates a future asset (however that asset may be realised).The damage done in respect of housing costs took decades to accumulate and it'll take decades to correct, but a fast fix would needlessly damage the economy.",dgfme5p,dgfaydv,662a5n,9.85E-06,-0.999980291,Against,18-04-17

Tory Brexit is far too destructive for me to vote for anyone who supports it. companies moving away, lower investment, lower gdp, lower consumer spending power, loss of our high status as bridge into EU (i.e. our special relationships with the US, etc): we are at the start of all these, and their negative impacts will be felt for years - and at the end of the rainbow, we find we have arrived at a place where we do trade deals with anyone, even if they torture citizens (Saudi), and even if we have to reduce climate change commitments and wildlife protection stances (South America), leaving us with a destroyed public sector (likely paying for NHS diagnosis and treatments) and fewer rights (de-regulation, doesn't give citizens higher rights).  Its not just experts saying this any more; Even the muppets in the brexit department recently managed to publish figures that make it look like EU membership has been financially good for the UK (https://www.indy100.com/article/brexit-mockery-praise-eu-david-davis-european-union-7688831?utm_source=indy&amp;utm_medium=top5&amp;utm_campaign=i100).  Here's another good article on the inanity of leaving (https://www.ft.com/content/202a60c0-cfd8-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377). that highlights some of the lies that were told to get people to vote leave as well. EU politicians aren't perfect, but the EU does have a long term commitment to protecting its citizens (from wars, from illness, from exploitation at work); and our politicians are just as bad, but by leaving we lose the 'wisdom of the crowds' impact of being part of a large political organisation (we lose stability; any loon can come into government and tear up laws left right and centre)This is a shitty place the Tories are building (ex EU UK) which will impact our children negatively.

Their constant rail roading of this has been disgusting (not leadership, more of a coup);  very few people had any desire to leave the EU before all this was whipped up by the Tories (I saw figures on that, am trying to find them again).  So this election is significantly to avoid Tories getting wiped out in 2020 (when we are in a mess so people realise they lied and someone more decent would have to finish the negotations); partly to put distance between this gov and the referendum (rats nest of lies and manipulations - there is no way that was strong enough foundation for such a big change - Tories hoping this GE gives them foundation); partly to take advantage of weak labour - Corbyn might have been out of the door after poor show in the local elections (leading to more contemporary/effective leader of opposition); also to avoid a general election in the middle of negotiations (2020), which last point actually seems sensible.  But I don't trust the Tories (based on the lies they've told; and their ideological drivers - free trade/low regulation/privatised public services) to deliver a sensible brexit, and I certainly don't trust them to remake fair laws after exit, so I will vote for the UK (i.e. not for the Tories). I agree; election won't heal the nation - to remainers, this feels like cynical manipulation of reality (1/2 people don't want this but it's being forced through), so ongoing resentment will happen - best way to heal is to define a deal and put it to 2nd ref I guess - though that might give another 50/50 maybe, which comes back to the crappy referendum in the first place - a 55/45 or 60/40 or such should have been required.",dggyhl1,dggl8rm,668nmx,0.049949115,-0.90010177,Against,19-04-17

17797,6,StrixTechnica,"Who's ""us""?  The EU?  Regardless of what the UK does, I don't rate highly our chances of a trade deal with EU anyway if the posturing from Verhofstadt, Tusk and van Rompuy are anything to go by.If the ECouncil or ECommission (or the EParliament, for that matter) have given us so little reason to believe that a reasonable deal is likely never mind possible, what reason have we not to pursue trade relations with other countries?  What possible reason have we not to do so with all haste?Whose fault will it be if the UK does so because of the (apparent) intransigence of the EU, especially if the UK takes the EU at its word rather than the EU's likely intentions?You can't have it both ways.The UK has a trade deficit with the EU; we import more of your stuff than you import of ours.  Obviously, the distribution and effect of that trade is not even, but EUâ†’UK exports are not distributed evenly across the whole of the EU either.  A lot of the high value stuff is quite concentrated.  Those EU businesses are not going to be best pleased if suddenly they have tariffs slapped on them.  MEPs might have some 'splaining to do in that event.And if the UK imposes tariffs on such goods because the EU imposes tariffs on UK goods, the UK is well motivated to find another source of those goods â€” quite possibly under a trade deal.  I am sure that there are plenty of people who'd be more than happy to take that business from you.  Japan, for one, whose economic woes have slogged on for decades.  The US seems quite keen, too.UKâ†’EU exports already account for less than half of our exports (a downward trend for years), and I'm sure there'll be markets other than the EU.  Plus, if we're on WTO tariffs, we have little incentive to actively market to the EU.*Building* barriers to trade is antithetical to what the EU was intended to do â€” I refer you to [Article 8 of the Lisbon Treaty](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-1-common-provisions/6-article-8.html) â€” and, I suggest, if that is the result then the EC is not adhering to the Lisbon Treaty and therefore is not doing its job properly.Which only goes to underscore Brexiteers' point that the EC is not fit for purpose.Meh, we'll survive, even if it means WTO tariffs.  It will suck for everyone including the EU27; it's not what the UK wants, but it's what everyone will get if the EU decides to be intransigent and let pragmatism play second fiddle to misplaced ideology.Be careful what you wish for.  Those like you who have expressed such ire toward the UK might just find that the punitively hard Brexit that you wish for cuts both ways.  You should not, for example, take intelligence sharing or law enforcement coÃ¶peration for granted.  And you should not underestimate the value of our intelligence capabilities.  No other EU country, for example, is a member of the Five Eyes community.If you maintain that the UK can't afford to lose the EU export market, ask yourself whether the EU can afford to lose access to UK intelligence quite besides UK exports.",dgjbiuu,dgiju6f,66fz4t,0.000233501,-0.999532999,Against,21-04-17
17798,6,StrixTechnica,"No, only that the EU is not the paramount or inevitable next evolution of humanity.  The UK, most of us, anyway, actually *like* Europe.  We just don't much like the EU bureaucracy.It shocks me to say it but, yes, some things in the past proved effective and are worth keeping.  Change for change's sake is not a good in itself.Which ideals are those?  Freedom and liberty?  Humanity has fought for such things for centuries if not millennia.See, that's where we differ.  I don't think that difference is a bad thing.  On the contrary, it's a good thing to be cherished.  What works for you may not work for me and visa versa.  National borders aren't quite so imaginary as you think.  Granted, they are somewhat arbitrary because they have to be drawn somewhere, but cultures *are* delineated, even if not so sharply as a border.  Indeed, distinct and separate cultures do exist within one country, and not always harmoniously.  Just look at what happened to Iraq and, before it, Yugoslavia to see what happens when the forces that bind them together are broken.  Or the plight of the Kurdish.Enmity and distrust are not an inevitable consequence of difference or, indeed, borders.  We do not have to be carbon copies of each other to live harmoniously.  In fact, differences can complement each other rather than conflict, unless one seeks to impose their way on others.  Which, BTW, is pretty much what the EC is doing to all 28 member states.But we can't have the flexibility to do what works best for us each respectively if we are bound by ""common policy"" made by distant, remote and unaccountable bureaucrats who have no particular investment or interest in *any* part of the Union, other than their own personal connections.The USSR proved that command economies don't work, and that excessive centralisation is ultimately unsustainable.  And yet that is exactly what the EU is heading toward, indeed, what you are advocating for.Sorry, but as the great lady said, ['no, no, no!'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2f8nYMCO2I)  If you can bear to, listen to the whole of her speech.  She foresaw where the then EEC was going and, IMV quite rightly, wanted none of it.I think we'd do better to respect each other for who we each are and, instead, set aside ideology.  Ideology is *terribly* dangerous.  Ideology starts wars.  Mutual respect and rapport, building relations complementing each other where possible, interacting where beneficial and giving each other space to differ where necessary â€” commonly known as diplomacy â€” is much better than insisting that everything is just *so*, and everyone must cleave to the same ideology regardless of how well or poorly it serves them.And we can.  But the EU is not the only (not even) the way to do that.You're half right, insofar as national governments are there to represent their citizens.  Oh, national governments have a lot to lose by political union, sure, but the people have even more to lose.I fear supranational political union far more than I fear my own government, and that's really saying something because the UK government can be pretty terrible at times.  At least, with a national government, we have a decent chance of doing something about it when they get it wrong without resorting to civil war in a way that we might not a United States of Europe.Yah.  Just ask anybody who grew up under a communist regime how well *that* worked for them.Did you ever read Orwell's book 1984?  In that book, the world had accreted into three sovereign powers: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia.  That book is fiction, but it is also political commentary we ignore at our peril.As for globalism, maybe, maybe not.  I know a lot of people would like it to, but I don't think it serves the working and middle classes of developed countries well.

Again you resort to belittling your opposition.  You also fail to reasonably argue your viewpoints.  The only thing in your first article is that they wanted to be able to raise the exit fee based on 'technical adjustment'.  It's not explained what that is at all.  But I would assume small things they didn't think of before hand.  Which should be a non-issue if those increases are limited.    The other argument they're upset about is that it should be paid in euro's.  Which would actually be a good deal if you believed the Pound would rise against the Euro.

Apart from a few hasty mis-pressed keys in my reply, my spelling and grammar were fine.. using the none word 'noone' is an affront to the English language. The rest of your grammar I have little regard for, I happily accept obvious typing errors and poorly constructed sentences.Remainers are shooting themselves in the foot with their childish response to the Brexit vote. I treat them with all the respect they deserve for their childish display of anti-democratic whining and whinging that the vote did not go their way. If it was not for the constant bitching of the remainers trying to have their say in the final outcome there would be no need for the election, but the constant negative attitude to a fantastic opportunity to bring the UK back to the world stage as a power house is forcing the hand of the Government to quieten the constant childish bitching..  hence no concrete plan.. Remoaners should follow the lead of their new Prime Minister, herself once a remainer, mature enough to rise over her personal opinion and do what is expected of Brexit for the majority who voted for Brexit. I commend her as a great example of what is expected from the vote.My viewpoints are not important, the bigger picture is the remoaners lost their say in the process when they voted to remain. They don't get to hijack the process to dilute it to suit their idea of Brexit.. Brexit should mean Brexit, not Halfexit.Do not conflate my passion for Great Britain and irritation at the remoaners as a maturity issue. I would have had no problem accepting defeat in the vote. Instead I have to watch children whining about losing easy access to Europe at the cost of their Sovereign Nation which cost the lives of millions of their country folk over the millennia to maintain that Sovereignty. The remoaners have no real idea what it going on, and little or no respect for Brexit, that is what raises my ire.The EU is a parasite to its host nations. -------------------There will be no exit fee paid. It's a bullshit sum pulled out of Junckers ass. Simples. Have faith.Business want to do business.

Ireland border formalities) then UK manufacturers on UK customs territory would still have to comply with UK product regulations as well as the export destinations (in the absence of an MRA). However, UK regulations may well be more suited to American tastes than EU ones (e.g. high wattage vacuum cleaners, I guess), and could well be better (not a high bar to clear after the VW exhaust scandal).Moreover I would be entirely unsurprised if after Brexit the UK declared an area near Liverpool's port to be an SEZ outside of UK customs territory. This would allow components from across the world to arrive in Liverpool tariff-free and ready for assembly, packaging etc. within the SEZ. Because it would be outside UK customs territory and producing solely for export I believe that products for the US market could ignore UK regulations and tailor the product specifically to the US market.The result would be products with identical but cheaper components and less regulatory overhead.

I'm living and working and earning in ireland, so for me that makes sense. - a personal financial advisor should be able to help you with the process and give you advice.The rules are a little subtle. The UK will allow pension transfer if the destination scheme has the same policies as uk scheme; so you can't transfer from U.K. scheme to a Dutch one that would allow you to get a tax free lump sum early - this is done to prevent tax avoidance. However there was an article after Brexit that there had been a run on the pension policies in the UK. The UK gov responded and surprisingly declared that all french and Italian schemes were not tax compliant (compatible) effectively blocking pension transfer.But your advisor should be able to dig out the necessary info, if they don't know it already.Just be sure to make your move before 2019, after that - it's all bets off.Good luck",dgpyp70,671f3h,671f3h,0.998778084,0.997556168,Brexit,25-04-17

18065,6,StrixTechnica,"1/2But some sure are, and I think this is the likely result of the policies and environment you do seem to advocate for.Never heard of it.  Meanwhile, the EU continues to accrete and centralise power.  Those with power do not usually give it up willingly.Can't work, for any number of reasons.  Here are a few:* What is in the public interest is not always what the public is interested in.  You have to have someone willing and able (ie have the authority) to have a care for the public interest when ordinary citizens can't or won't.  There is an immense amount of very necessary work and regulatory machinery (think environmental, financial, natural resources (eg RF spectrum, airspace), trading standards and so much more).* Fiat currency is not something that can work without a central bank â€” one reason why the â‚¬ is doomed, btw, unless the ECB actually starts acting like a central bank, which it can't really do without some degree of fiscal policy (ie political) union â€” and that requires a government to legitimise it.  (Look back to the [history of the US dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System#History) to see what happens when there isn't a central bank.)* Most laws require a central authority to impose them and legitimise them via the judiciary, and that central authority must be accountable to someone, preferably the citizens governed by that law.  That central authority is more or less what a government is.* National defence is also something you can't outsource or do ad hoc.* International trading policies require governments with which to negotiate, as representatives of the shareholders (if you like) in the country's aggregate production and consumption.The list goes on.  Once, maybe, we could do without governments, but that hasn't been possible since the 17th or 18th C or maybe even the medieval era.One of the problems with economics as a subject area is that it assumes that people are rational actors that will always act in their own best self interests.  First, that's not true, there's a great deal of sentimentality in economic actors' behaviour (including financial and investment institutions) and second, even if it were there would still be the need to regulate when there is market failure (think [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) or, for a more recent example, natural monopolies acquired by private interests such as BT which required OfCom to intervene when it became clear that it wasn't going to give competitors fair access to its last-mile copper unless forced to).This idea not only assumes that the participants in the network are rational but *also* that they are interested and engaged. Frankly, most people have no energy left once they've done what's required to survive (work, look after family etc).  If you have the luxury of any amount of daily leisure time, you should not assume that everyone does.  And if you don't, you'll know what I'm talking about.I'd add that application of principles of computer scientists to messy and inconsistent humans is unwise.  (I'm a computer scientist as well active in politics, so I feel I'm well placed to suggest hat the two don't mix very well.)*Anything* can be used as a currency, but that doesn't mean that anything *should* be.  I won't have anything to do with cryptocurrencies, for example, because they don't represent anything real.Government fiat currencies, while not backed by something like gold (which I always did think was completely arbitrary and pointless; also, history shows that [the gold standard doesn't work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system)), are still shares in that country's GNP.  But in order to have a GNP, you have to define what a country is.  That requires national borders and national policy set by governments.Cryptocurrencies, OTOH, are more like shares in some (relatively) fixed quantity of some arbitrary good, whether it be gold or collectable cards.  They have no intrinsic value (nor does gold, for that matter), they only have value because people *agree* they have value.  The same is true of fiat currencies, the difference is that national production (especially agricultural) is far more likely to retain its agreed-value than collectable cards.  All it would take is one or two more sizeable, well-publicized [hacks for bitcoin](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-07/hacked-bitcoin-exchange-users-to-lose-36-will-receive-tokens) to completely lose its value.  There'd be a run on the ""bank"", just as in the old days, and very quickly the market won't be able to price it.  That already happened with the Zimbabwean dollar, and routinely happens on the equity markets.  And when nobody can agree on a price for a thing, it becomes worthless, just as the Zimbabwean dollar is.None of any consequence, and if you are not afraid of electronic voting where there *is* consequence (unless there's a paper audit trail), then you're a fool.Just imagine had the Brexit vote been done electronically and without any ability to audit the result.  Most people in this sub would not be very happy given the result delivered under those circumstances.Just because cloud resources aren't obviously geographically based does not free them from statutory jurisdiction.  Case in point: [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster#Legal_challenges) although, if you're a millennial, that might be before your time.  I could give less savoury examples that would not be welcomed by the sub's mods.Quite apart from tort law and especially law *mala prohibita*, there is a great deal of contract law to consider: with whom are you contracting when you buy cloud services, under what governing jurisdiction and what is that jurisdiction's ability to enforce the contract?  If you read most EULAs carefully (especially for online services), you will find out where that jurisdiction is, and you can estimate your chances of enforcing your rights, should it become necessary.  For example, a contract formed in the US or UK is probably a lot safer than one formed in Russia.The Internet is not nearly as robust as people commonly suppose.  There have been times when BGP (Border Gateway Protocol, the primary basis for world IP route propagation) began to look as though it might be on thin ice, and there is some speculation as to what would happen if all or even most of the DNS root servers went down.BGP depends on being able to do fast lookups, but BGP tables have been (or were at one stage) growing seemingly without bound, threatening to grow bigger than hardware's ability to store them.  Because DNS is intrinsically a caching technology, trying to bootstrap the world *ab initio* with the current number of users might prove impossible.  The DNS roots would get DDoS'd.In the event of some catastrophic DNS crash, the system *could* be restored by staging it over several days, but it'd probably be a week or two before things were fully restored to normal.DDoSes remain an intractably insolvable problem.(cont'd...)",dgrs7xf,dgk5ej3,66fz4t,0.023900927,-0.952198145,Against,26-04-17
18066,6,StrixTechnica,"(... cont'd, 2/2)In essence, power.  What the policies are, who gets to set them and what recourse in the event of a policy you don't like.A fairly innocuous example, consider the 2016 Ghostbusters movie: that never showed in China, *cannot* ever (legally) be shown in China, because Chinese law prohibits public depiction of the supernatural.You might think that's crazy, but that's Chinese law.  The Chinese probably think that's crazy, but they have no means of telling their government that there's a majority of people who want that policy changed.Nature abhors a vacuum, and so it is with the politics of power.  Where one power disappears, many new powers will rise, like the proverbial [Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lernaean_Hydra).  The history of that situation is not a happy one: just look at Afghanistan and Iraq.To borrow from fiction, Voldemort to Harry: ""There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it"".  Suppose you can achieve your governmentless world, it might even be stable for a while.  But it is intrinsically unstable and aspiration (as expressed in Lennon's ""[Imagine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_\(John_Lennon_song\))"") eventually gives way to natural forces.Eventually, there will be those who seek to impose their will on others, whether by force or by some other means.  Two world wars saw the attempt to do so by force.  As a direct result, the EEC and then EU via the Treaties of Rome, Maastricht and Lisbon arose, which rather proves my point:Even if, *arguendo*, the EEC were entirely benign in intention, the EU shows how the benign can turn malignant.  What started off as a trading bloc of independent states turned into an ever-more expansive bureaucracy that already has gone far beyond trade and related policy.  Even where it is trade related, who cares what [size and shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_Regulation_\(EC\)_No._2257/94) fruit and veg are?  Is it really that important to useful trade, provided nobody is being ripped off?Many who voted 'leave', like me, foresee this trend continuing until complete political integration and union has been achieved, and we don't want any part of it.  And nor should youâ€”â€”because a supranational state is going in entirely the wrong direction to accomplish that.  You've still got a state, it's just a much bigger and less agile, one riven by internal politics and much, much harder to deal with.Worse, the only way you'll get a truly ""global people"" is if there is one world government which would be even less efficient and unresponsive to regional needs and, more to the point, *still a government*.  Only now, it has no competition to keep it honest or hold it accountable.  The only possible recourse in that situation is civil war.  War was precisely what the EU project was intended to avoid.C.f. my remarks about power: proverbial 'world domination' is the subject of much fiction which explores the intentions and outcomes of such scenarios.There's a lot of good 'hard' science fiction and 'future history' novels that explore the nature of power and governance.  Jerry Pournelle's [CoDominium series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoDominium) is but one good example.  Star trek is nothing of the sort.  There is no reason to suppose such a political system is practical; rather, ST is a vehicle for social commentary on issues of the (then) present.Good, because it'll never happen.  History has shown time and again that you cannot force it, and people will not willingly do it.  We are, by nature, a diverse species but we do not naturally tolerate excessive difference (xenophobia) but nor, I suspect, would we tolerate excessive homogeneity.  If it were otherwise, party politics would probably disappear and there would never be any revolutionary movement to worry about.That state of affairs has never, ever happened anywhere in the world at any time in history for any length of time in any stable fashion.No, they're not, but they're a function of and an expression of the culture of the electorate â€” thus it's not government's job to determine culture.  To the extent that it has anything to do with culture, it is the expression of the will of the governed.  Government makes a good servant, but a very, very poor master.See above: taking power from Westminster only to give it to Brussels does not remove power, it only transfers it â€” and not in a useful or good way.If anything, decentralisation looks more like what you appear to envisage.  Returning power to Westminster may not be enough: perhaps some more regional government is required.

18070,6,StrixTechnica,"1/2First, there aren't that many 'leavers' who actually want a hard Brexit and even those that do most likely are motivated by the EU's apparently hard-line on trade agreements.Here's my bottom line: I don't want the UK to be the EU's doormat.  We have no meaningful influence in EU politics or policy and while there are undoubtedly benefits to membership, there are undoubtedly disadvantages.In the early days of the question of EU independence, I was a remainer.  I would really rather not have voted to leave, but I did so because while I value much about Europe (and a fair bit about the EU), I am not prepared to accept political union.I voted leave because that is the inexorable direction of the EU unless something dramatic forces it to change course.  We tried to reform it from within but could not, so the least worst alternative is to leave.  If that means a hard Brexit, then so be it, though I would really rather not go that route unless forced to by the ECommission.Perhaps Brexit will be the catalyst that causes reform.  Perhaps the inevitable implosion of the â‚¬ will.  If so, then I would really rather not be around when it happens, but I would really rather it not happen at all because it's not good for Britain and, just as importantly, it's not good for citizens of the EU27.  If you're Irish, you should well understand the economics of the â‚¬.Now that's ironic, because the worst I hear ""Brexiteers"" say about leavers is to call them ""remoaners"" â€” not, I hope you'll notice, a term I choose to use â€” whereas many in the EU27 and many in the British 'remain' camp insist on calling 'leavers' racists, xenophobes, uneducated, simple-minded, mad and, yes, nazis and other sorts of supremacists amongst many less savoury epithets.So explain why Canada gets a free trade agreement without the obligation of freedom of movement of labour or capital and why we should not?That is your rather subjective opinion â€” a perfectly valid and respectable position, but a political opinion nevertheless.One of the big motivators for Brexit is precisely the idea that one member state should interfere with the internal politics of another.  (C.f. Madrid &amp; Gibraltar.)  I wouldn't dream of doing so in Ireland, though that's not to say we don't have common interests on which we can/should/must coÃ¶perate, especially the Good Friday Agreement, so it bemuses me when people from the EU27 feel entitled to say how Britons should conduct their affairs.I've seen very little evidence of hostility toward citizens of the EU27 (indeed, I have at least two first cousins-in-law that are EU nationals) â€” but I've seen quite a lot of hostility toward the EU as a bureaucracy (as distinct from the national governments of its member states).The EU â‰  Europe.  Most Britons, myself included, like Europe and Europeans.  I don't much like the EU as a political entity, however.On the contrary, it is in no-one's interests for Europe to fall apart and so far as I know, few 'leavers' want that either.  The EU, itself, is another matter altogether, but see above.  No-one in Britain wishes economic or political harm to EU citizens.  Shame the same is not always reciprocated, especially those who hate the UK so much for Brexit that they want to punish us for daring to disagree with their political vision.You call it mad because you disagree with our decision.  That is your right, but that does not make it reasonable.  I am sure that EU27 Eurosceptics would not call us mad for the complementary reason: they agree with us.Last I looked less than half of UK exports went directly to non EU countries.  If what you say is true, then we can deal directly with those non-EU countries rather than via the EU.There is no particular down-side from this perspective, that I can see.Not even most 'leavers' want to stop trading with Europe â€” and we still will, even if only on WTO terms.  The only reason we'd end up on WTO terms is because the EC won't do a trade agreement because they'd rather let political priorities trump economic ones.According to Wikipedia's [list of countries by GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_\(nominal\)), the UN estimates of EU and UK GDP are US$18.5tn and US$2.9tn respectively.  When the UK leaves the EU, the EU GDP will fall by 16% overnight â€” a sizeable dent in anyone's money â€” but it will still be second largest trading bloc in the world.  But the EU (for now) remains a trading bloc, not a sovereign political entity.But, [UKâ†’EU exports for 2016](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/Pages/Annual-Tables.aspx) were only some US$183bn at the current value of the Â£, which is only 6.3% of the UK's GDP.  That's not an insignificant volume of trade and though WTO tariffs would put a dent it it, we won't lose all of it â€” while at the same time opening new markets elsewhere.The flip side are EUâ†’UK exports, and certain high-value companies that export high-value goods (notably cars which will be amongst the worst hit by WTO tariffs) are economically very concentrated within the EU.  Any harm to those companies has a knock-on effect to the intra-EU supply chain, so this is not a one-sided issue.In any event, Brexit is not wholly about economics.  If Brexit were purely an economic matter, I would not have voted to leave.  I voted to leave primarily on the grounds of sovereignty, though I also happen think it's in the UK's long term best economic interests â€” and I don't believe that you'd vote against Ireland's interests were it a choice between Ireland and everybody else â€” to get out now because I don't see the â‚¬ ending up well.  The economics of it just don't work.Yes, but I don't think that matters nearly half as much as per-capita economics.  Even within the EU, each member state is nominally sovereign and in charge of its own fiscal policy, so nothing about EU membership guarantees that business will go to one country rather than another so, for the purposes of macroeconomic analysis, you can't treat the EU as a monolithic bloc.From the perspective of individual EU citizens, what matters is how much work is available in their locality and how healthy the economics of their nation is.  The EU does nothing to secure that and, if anything, does a lot to undermine it (especially in the southern periphery).  IIRC, youth unemployment in Spain and southern Italy is something like 50%.How does the EU benefit them?  How can it ever?Actually, no, that's almost completely wrong.  First, we can't negotiate trade deals with individual EU member states because EU rules prohibit member states from doing so.  Yes, we'd have to renegotiate trade deals with countries with which the EU already has trade agreements, but that won't be as difficult as you make out (or take nearly as long as you suggest) because a large part of trade negotiation is reconciling standards and regulations.  Since we already *are* compliant with EU standards and regulation, that job is already done.  It then becomes a political matter of who is willing to give what in which sector and under what terms.  Any significantly sized non-EU country with an existing EU agreement (notably Canada and South Korea) has plenty of motivation to do a trade deal with the UK so's not to lose out on their exports to us, and it should be relatively quick and easy to arrange it (given the political will) because the regulatory framework is already in place.  From our pov, *in addition*, we get to negotiate with other countries we couldn't reach a deal with before.  Trump vetoed TPP and yet our prospects with the US look good, and Canada is a commonwealth country with our Queen still on their bank notes, as is Australia.  Both seem keen to do a trade deal with us because we're still (and will continue to be) a large economy to which those markets would very much like access.India would be an obvious choice but that deal may be difficult.  OTOH, it's not like the EU has a trade deal with them either.Actually, yes, I think TPP and TTIP are terrible ideas.  At least a UK-US deal would be bilateral, and we tailor the agreement to suit both countries without the compromises involved in having over two dozen parties in a multilateral agreement.It depends on what you value most and therefore what you consider to be 'worse off'.  If you value comfort and an easy life, you probably will be motivated by economic factors most.  If you value identity, freedom and self-determination, then while economics are still important, the balance will shift.I'd rather tolerate a period of economic difficulty than give up so readily what some 80 million people in two world wars died for of which at least 30 million were combatants).  Those who died to fight tyranny and fascism (and I mean the Axis powers of WW2) deserve better.(cont'd...)",dgrx4hv,dgjwb9t,66fz4t,1.07E-17,-1,Against,26-04-17
18071,6,StrixTechnica,"(cont'd... 2/2)Okay, this whole thing illustrates how preposterous the whole debate has become.  First, the UK would like a trade deal with the EU but the EU wants to punish the UK for daring to challenge their power â€” and *we're* the hostile ones?Second, who would you not fight to preserve Irish territories?  Indeed, I should not have to remind you that a handful *did* fight the UK for decades over Northern Ireland (fighting which, btw, persisted for decades after both Ireland and the UK joined the EU so the EU's anti-war efforts didn't do so well there and the GFA was accomplished not by Eurocrats but by the good will of the RoI and UK governments).Yes, we'd go to war with Spain if they invaded or committed an act of war against a British sovereign territory (or dependency, in the case of Gibraltar), just as we did when Argentina invaded the Falklands.  But all of this would equally be true were Spain to invade Gibraltar whilst we're still a member of the EU.Besides, it's entirely hypocritical of Madrid to complain about Gibraltar when Spain itself has enclaves and overseas territories, including northwest Africa.The whole episode concerning Gibraltar would not have resulted in such bellicose language had it not been for Madrid's apparent insistence that it have some additional veto in respect of any deal between the UK and the EU where it concerns Gibraltar.  That sabre was rattled by Madrid, not London â€” and, again, *we're* the hostile ones?And *mutatis mutandis*.Why is the political entity that is the EU, specifically, more important than the social and economic welfare of EU citizens?  As I've pointed out, the EU â‰  Europe and it is in no way inevitable that either depend on the EU as it now is.The economic significance is obvious, but what is so sacred about the single market in political terms?  And yet the US, the largest single economy in the world, is not a member of the common market and it seems to enjoy a fairly decent standard of living, as do most of the Commonwealth countries.So do I, and so do I.  By your logic, the US ought to have the living standards of India or China, and yet it does not, not even within the IT sector.  There are many, many other factors in play besides just the common market.Oddly, many remainers cite globalism as a thing of worth, yet the single market is a protectionist bloc that is also antithetical to globalism.  (FWIW, I don't think unfettered globalism *is* a good thing, so I don't object to trade barriers where appropriate).International trade has gone on for millennia (the Silk Road dated to 120 BCE), long before even the EEC was conceived of in the '50s.  Trade will continue, with or without the EU.Actually, no, I've never had much time for games.  As a kid, I was busy learning about IT, tech and the natural sciences.  As an adult, I've got a job to worry about amongst many other demands on my time.Quite right, 's called politics and it is a very dirty business indeed.If you mean WTO terms, I think it's the least-worst option in terms of our political survival as an independent, sovereign nation which we now are only in name.*We can do better* if there is the political will to do so.  It should be clear enough there is on the UK side, the only question is whether there is on the EU side.  So again I ask, who are the hostile actors in this scenario?  If WTO is the result, whose fault will that be?The only fight is the fight you bring with you.And even after Brexit, we still can, just as the EU member states work with non-EU states within NATO, the IMF, the UN and a host of other international bodies.  Nothing need change in that respect.No, Britain has only said that it no longer wishes to be subject to Brussels or the ECJ.  (NB: we're not withdrawing from the ECHR.)Again, the only fight is the fight that others bring to the UK, and that is only happening because the EU doesn't want to let its second biggest net contributor and world's 5th largest market economy to leave the union.I don't blame them, the self-interest is entirely justified.  But the *quid pro quo* of that is, so is ours.At least we agree on one thing.  But I suggest that, if you want to take it up with anyone, have a word with Tusk and Juncker.",dgrx4xh,dgjwb9t,66fz4t,4.49E-07,-0.999999102,Against,26-04-17

The extent of these crimes were near-zero in the dough-eyed era of Europe before mass migration and before the post-2008 crisis, but now we are having them as daily occurrences all over. Let's focus on the failures of the migrantion policy:There are entire areas of cities in Belgium, France and Sweden where the intelligence services have lost the radar and the police can't enforce themselves effectively. As minority groups increase they seek more political representation and to usurp the  system they do not respect (see the effect instruction from Erdogan had on the Dutch elections via the burgeoning Turkish community).The best the established press have to offer those with two concerns is 'not all Muslims' 'meet hate with love', this is weak and ineffective.Crimes associated with these communities are consistently covered up and underreported across the board. See Rotherham in the UK, the lack of cultural identifiers in French and Swedish crime data, the teaching of girls to keep their distance in Germany, the weakness of the police to enforce real sentencing, I.e. the last terror attack in France the culprit had been to prison for *attempting to kill police* prior. The EUs dogma for 'tolerance' has Lea to a demonstrable break down in law and order. In many capitals now women do not feel safe to walk alone or are on guard, that to me is as significant a failure of duty as any terrorist who slips through the net is, and yet it is more and more normalised.So no, I don't read it in the BBC or Guardian because I cannot find it, where I find it is from real people living in Molenbeek, living in Malmo, living in Nice, at the heart of it, not champaign socialists in the trendy burbs of Berlin (mass sexual violence last New Years anyone?

British goods would be subject to the full European common external tariffs, customs controls and very restrictive non-tariff barriers â€“ creating supply chain chaos. Exports losses on UK goods would reach Â£30 billion. Services would have not special access to the EU market; financial services would lose passporting rights â€“ equivalent to 20-30% in additional cost, or a loss of Â£36 billion in UK services exports. In this strained context, sterling would depreciate 20% against the euro in 2019. Foreign direct investment could fall, and, given the economic outlook, investment could decline by 8%. Inflation would accelerate significantly (2019: +3.5%), directly and negatively impacting consumer spending (-1%). A UK recession would take hold from 2019, with GDP declining by 1.2%,â€ explained Ana Boata.",dgwliwe,dgw2h7f,6851nf,1.36E-06,-0.999997281,Against,29-04-17

Tories will be desperate for trade deals (to halt inevitable gdp loss from brexit), so there's credible talk of them ignoring human rights contraventions with trade partners (like Saudi) and reducing climate concerns/wildlife protection (to trade with south America), but to trade with the EU (~50% of our exports) we will have to retain some standards (as they require it of their trade partners, even arms length ones).   Looks like a paradox: Tories can't change the country sufficiently to eventually compensate for all the damage they are doing (implementing their Tory wet dream, free trade hub), unless they drop out of EU completely, which will wreak chaos with our economy: quite a nice definition of the stupidity which is Brexit - it seems to be an unresolvable paradox (i.e. the UK population cannot 'win' the Brexit game).re: death penalty, I doubt it would be a high priority - but with the right wing papers setting our national agenda, it is not impossible.  Whether the gov could implement it depends on what happens next.  The ""great repeal bill"" will be critical legislature - there *must* be parliamentary safeguards in there - and that is one significant reason why the Tories cannot be allowed a large majority (i.e. tactical voting is required but that might not be enough; we've also each got to help each other understand what brexit actually is - so that more people notice the deafening warning bells)this is good on the repeal bill. https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/brexit-explained/brexit-explained-great-repeal-billthese look like useful starters on rights (I've not read them; the above is formed from prior reading). https://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/human-rights/human-rights-uk-after-brexithttps://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/feb/21/top-lawyers-warn-of-human-rights-crisis-after-brexithttps://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-does-brexit-mean-equality-and-human-rights-ukhttps://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiipJ7Fx9HTAhVjCcAKHdr8BeoQFghJMAY&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lse.ac.uk%2FeuropeanInstitute%2FLSE-Commission%2FHearing-6---The-implications-of-Brexit-for-fundamental-rights-protection-in-the-UK.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRbLFFQWskvU7D-_WX4N1UJpa6oA",dh1ay8f,68splh,68splh,6.81E-08,-0.999999864,Against,02-05-17

18362,6,SKZCartoons,"Many are very happy. Mainly because the major politicians in the Tory and Labour parties have all failed to grasp what leaving actually means. Both May (our PM) and Corbyn (main opposition) wanted to leave. They are telling everyone it'll be great as long as it's done their way.So they are both quite happy. But they have both hugely misunderstood what leaving actually means. Corbyn appears to be having some second thoughts, and is demanding a deal which leaves the UK ""no worse off"". He doesn't seem to know that that is impossible.May talks it up, too. Even more so. So the leave voters are very happy. They only hear that it's going to be great.One reason May called the snap election is probably because the negative effects are about to start kicking in. Inflation and job relocation away from the UK  is going to be in the news a lot these next few months. So she wants to have the election before most Leave voters start to twig that they were sold a bad deal which will give them none of the benefits they wanted (including reduced immigration) and will have huge downsides.Some Remainers are resigned to it. But many are still angry and still fighting.Hardcore leavers have become increasingly aggressive, using insults and threats instead of debating. This is even the case with senior politicians like Lord Ashcroft, who recently ""threatened"" the EU that the UK would leave without a deal.https://twitter.com/LordAshcroft/status/858645736854102016Like a playground bully threatening to punch himself in the face if the kid refuses to give him sweets. It's just hugely bizarre.The racism and ridiculous posturing of nationalism remains. Some Leavers are proudly telling people to go back home or to get out of the country.

It's actually humiliating to watch them do it.Obviously not all leavers are like this, and it's probably just a vocal minority. But nobody is telling them to stop. Indeed, May herself is encouraging it, as are her senior politicians. This election, we are told, is to stop the ""saboteurs"".The right wing newspapers rabidly scream about ""traitors"". And again, the politicians encourage this.So May is calling 48% of her own people saboteurs and in the next breath she's claiming the country is unified.It isn't. It likely won't be for at least two generations. The atmosphere is too toxic and is being fed by the people who will be running the country for at least the next 5 years.

18387,6,Shanyi,"Same as before, really. Both sides are convinced their view is the only right one and the other side pure, vindictive stupidity. Leavers think all Remainers are unpatriotic, anti-democracy, patronising elitists who voted purely how their European masters told them. Remainers think all Leavers are braindead racists who don't know what's good for them and voted purely how their right-wing masters told them. Each sides' behaviour and anger only validates the other's opinion, even if each is only looking to be validated to begin with, helped by a similar split in the media where left-wing publications (Guardian, Independent, etc) offer nothing but fearmongering and taking everything the EU says as gospel, where right-wing publications (Daily Mail, Telegraph) offer nothing but visions of a Britain emerging with the best of every possible world and taking everything Westminster says as gospel. In other words, nothing changes, most people vocal enough to have an audible voice have simply hardened their original positions, most others just seem sick of hearing about it all the time and just want to get on with it, and reasoned analysis is taking a long holiday with no end in sight.From my perspective, I'm a Remainer on balance, but have little love for the EU as an organisation (the people of Europe are, of course, delightful). I don't see it in anyone's interests if the EU collapses or the UK gets taken for a ride, given how much we both rely on each other. Even if no deal IS better than a terrible* deal on the basic principle that no deal can eventually become a good deal, whereas a terrible deal is almost impossible for the weaker side to improve, but no deal would still be catastrophic for both sides, albeit in different ways. The UK economy would take an enormous direct hit and customs would be thrown into chaos. The EU as a whole would take a much smaller hit, but individual economies, especially the fragile recovery in Spain, could be put under further pressure, increasing the vulnerability to cascade failure in the long term. Neither side will collapse no matter what: the UK's economy is big and versatile enough, with outstanding existing infrastructure, to not crumble even with the almighty hit and ensuing chaos that would undoubtedly be the consequence of failed negotiations, while the UK may be one of the EU's major trading partners and net economic contributors, but is not so closely integrated or such an enormous part of the overall economy to do fatal damage on its own. If both sides can grow up and give all this empty grandstanding and intransigence a rest, it shouldn't be too difficult to form the basis of a mutually beneficial outcome given how much we have in common after 43 years, but both will have to make compromises, which is sadly looking unlikely right now.*'Bad', 'terrible' etc. are obviously relative terms depending on one's interpretation, particularly when whatever EU-UK relationship that does emerge will be very different from the one that exists now. So I'm assuming a 'worst of all worlds' deal for the UK where we still pay into the EU budget, have an enormous divorce bill, lose influence, passporting, still have free movement but more limited single market access and no ability to negotiate outside trade, etc. If a 'bad' deal is interpreted as losing a number of existing privileges (full single market access, benefits of customs union, etc) but gaining freedom in other areas (immigration, supremacy of UK law, negotiate own trade deals), that deal would obviously be vastly better than no deal. But as mentioned, the terms are so relative and variable that, as a statement, its meaning and worth is inherently limited.",dh38jvy,68z99j,68z99j,9.13E-07,-0.999998175,Against,03-05-17

The European commission proposes laws which are then ratified by the only democratically elected parliament in the world which cannot propose legislation. They also have to be approved by the european council. This is made up of government ministers from each of the member states.

This allows small businesses to be strangled by regulations thus removing competition from the kind of businesses that can afford lobbying.honestly, there is a far more simple explanation than some crackpot arms-dealer based conspiracy: The failure of the remain campaign to set out a positive argument for remaining in the european union. The remain campaign's arguement that anyone who disagreed with membership of the european union is a bigoted racist served only to alienate a substantial proportion of the electorate.

18469,6,amgiecorker,"Long reply with evidence followsThe short reply is that on such an important topic, its critical to have awareness of different perspectives, especially if your normal sources are manipulating the truth in an attempt to affect your behaviour (certainly seems true of the tabloids I mentioned).  There is reams of evidence that the right wing papers are attempting to manipulate readers (with bias, and selective fact picking, and sometimes lies) into supporting Brexit, and May, and that is having a poisonous effect on the country.  (There is also plenty of evidence that May is manipulating voters of course: the papers reinforce those manipulations and that is the poisonous part - political manipulations being presented as 'news')long reply:An important point to emphasise is different perspectives are required - if we only ever get one, then that's the one that becomes influential over time - persuasion.  The digital divide seems relevant here - I'm easily able to access a variety of perspectives (and to evaluate evidence sources) because I'm e-literate; many people are not, and those people (older, less educated (not less intelligent),  etc).  So part of this is trying to bridge that divide - almost literally, there's a chasm of info rich/info poor which is aligned with remain/leave.   We can't do that effectively by posting on line - for obvious reasons - so we all need to help by taking physical, real world actions.But it goes way beyond that; the papers I mentioned aren't just presenting one perspective; they are presenting a warped one, manipulating readers.  In my opinion for the pursuance of their owners/editors ideological goals (which May is also serving/pursuing).   Here's good examples of these right wing papers breaking regs around the referendum in an attempt to get UK to vote leave (http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/ipso-rulings-media-eu_uk_58d27bbfe4b0f838c62e298b).  There are other factors in the leave/remain demographic but these papers contributed with their constant bias and mis-information, and are read by the majority of paper readers in this country (https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-analysis-shows-extent-of-press-bias-towards-brexit-61106). and they are continuing their bias and mis-information. Here's one simple example from the one day this week that I compared the (online) stories.  This sort of bias, repeated again and again, is clearly influential - or to put it more simply, the mail (the paper in this example) is definitely manipulating its readers but its readers are used to it and hardly notice (they have an abusive relationship with that paper, basically)Mail has this headline: ""Brussels admits it faces an 'explosive' crisis if UK refuses Brexit bill: Chief negotiator makes shock admission that the bloc could crumble if Britain resists payment""(Barnier said failure to clear accounts may cause the political situation to ""be explosive if we have to stop programmes"", there's no mention of him claiming the bloc would crumble)Guardian: ""UK's financial obligations to EU will be 'incontestable', says Barnier"" (yes, there's a quote of him saying that). bear in mind that's only one small example (there were more examples, in the one article I read this week) of constant, ongoing attempts to sway reader opinions.  and there's a strong link with papers supporting May (aka ""Mother Theresa"" in the mail) - she's proven liar and strongly manipulating the UK population to opportunistically reach her own goals, at the expense of those readers - but a lot of the readers of these papers aren't aware - seriously, I read the mail a couple of weeks ago as well, and both times, they represented 'no deal' as a sensible idea - it would be disastrous for the UK short through medium term, but it would serve far right ideology, at our expense)This severe bias seems to be true of the other right wing papers I mentioned as well (â€œthere is a pattern of misleading articles in these particular newspapers  and IPSO should investigate their overall poor editorial standards, not just individual stories.â€, http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/inaccurate-newspaper-stories-misled-the-british-public-when-they-voted-remain-says-founder-of-pro-eu-fact-checking-website/)check these two articles for more.  The second explicitly finds ""data suggest that British people are less knowledgeable about the EU than the citizens of any other member state"" and the first mentions that people ""changed their voting intentions as they â€œbecame more aware of their lack of knowledge, or thought more in depth about what being a member of the European Union meansâ€.""http://ukandeu.ac.uk/british-media-coverage-of-europe-is-letting-voters-down/http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2015/11/27/brits-know-less-about-the-eu-than-anyone-else/No Tory gov, and not the last labour one, will sort regulation, as they are dependent on these papers to get elected.  so we (the people) have to help the readers of these papers understand (out of compassion for sure, but also because it is biasing the national debate - for decades - and it is leading the UK into making irrational choices)here are good examples of the tactics used to manipulate readers: https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvy8j259jTAhWhLMAKHaH4CZsQFggyMAE&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhackinginquiry.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2FFailureOfIPSO.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1oNsV0f1nzhPtBVL43RpHVEw6nQ",dh5zyge,dh5ofzf,6967a6,1.15E-13,-1,Against,05-05-17

I personally see the negative impacts from the union as being more subtle and insidious contributing to a widened gulf between rich and poor and in terms of both wealth and power, as clichÃ© as that sounds.  Focusing on free movement of labour only, I subscribe to the notion that it lowers the wages and rights of unskilled workers in the uk. Having worked in a bar, call centre and next to an agricultural farm when I was younger, the low skilled jobs offerred by these places were saturated with eastern European workers and we would receive cvs almost  every day from applicants looking for work. Why this is good: labour is cheap and easy to find so the business owner can benefit. Additionally with cheap labour products can be cheaper so the consumer benefits. Why this is bad: I see this as putting the power in the hands of employers and facilitating the abuse of workers rights with no regard made for their development, wage growth and personal circumstances. The whole sports direct fiasco comes to mind. Additionally if foreign born workers are looking to send earned money to family back home, this takes money out of the uk where it might have been spent in shops.People might frame the above assessment as simplistic, or put across the narrative that this is the eu working as it should, but in the age of pro european new labour and the cameron/clegg years, how were low skilled workers expected to compete and carve careers?

If not what are the prospects for people on insecure working hours? Can these people put money into a pension?  What does the future hold for these people?A great majority of the above is due to domestic policies, but the eu does nothing to:a) provide incentives for the uk to invest in these people; what's the point when cheap eu labour is availableB) allow for the protection of home industries. Think uk steel.Having the ability to set trade barriers and restrict immigration levels is very important and is absolutely necessary if a country is to have a balanced economy. I believe in an eu, but not on the level of 28 countries with the diversity in economies that the current union has. Protectionism has a bad name at the moment, but it shouldn't be a taboo; it protects people.I do not agree that the eu has forced workers rights on the uk, when the uk has had comparitively quite a good record in this area.

18560,6,Shalalalasha,"Hi, there are many types of calamity that the Brexit vote seems to have prevented/limited. For example, the previous government was obsessed with cutting the deficit even if it caused enormous personal harm to many. This was justified on the basis that disaster would strike if markets lost confidence in Britain. This doctrine was used to justify many short-sighted policies across the developed world. Sycophancy to business; cruelty to the poor.Project Fear took this elevation of Market Confidence to the extreme, telling us that the Markets hated the idea of Brexit and their lack of Confidence in Britain's economy would send it into a death spiral. We voted to leave anyway, and basically nothing changed in the economy aside from a currency revaluation. We called the bluff of this pernicious doctrine, and destroyed its intellectual basis. I haven't heard anyone pray to the great god Market Confidence for months. Osborne has gone from being PM-in-waiting to ex-MP. Hammond is a cautious, change-little Chancellor, but he's kicked the obsession with the deficit into touch.Also (though of course many would not welcome this) Brexit seems to have averted Scottish independence. Before the vote it looked inevitable. Now even the SNP say that after a few years it would be ""too difficult"", i.e. too difficult to persuade the electorate.

Unless you're trying to argue that Theresa is an undemocratic leader - in which brexit won't help.  The EU knows what is best for the Euro.  At no point was control taken away from Greece.  They are able to govern themselves.  They are not children and should be accountable for their actions.  Firstly, they got themselves in the economic crisis via their own democraticly chosen government.  Second, they chose the austerity measures that were part of the deal as an exit plan.    Blaming the EU for the choices made is shifting blame.  And if the EU is so evil to make them take the deal, then I'm sure the UK sent low interest rate loans to aid the back broken greeks right?

With the imposition of EU third country customs formalities particularly on agri-goods for which UK infrastructure and its businesses will be ill prepared for combined with the fact the UK will not have a functioning customs system post such an exit as there is no possibility of HMRC and port authorities being able to adapt to this in the time available will bring gridlock to UK ports particularly ro-ro facilities at Dover. Trade will grind to a halt. Operation Stack will become the norm with lorries parked alongside the M20 and around the M25. There is no way this can be fixed; trade will first be choked off to the trickle as can be handled by a paper system. Impact of this?

18619,6,Shanyi,"My reaction to that wasn't what a disaster it will be when Brexit happens, as I suspect the segment makers were going for. My reaction was 'holy hell, not only is this a staggeringly inefficient process, but moving cylinder blocks back and forth across the continent must be terrible for the environment'. Do these blocks really have to go from Italy to Germany just to be coated, for instance? I can sympathise with the fact that not every country has the workforce and skills required to do everything either in satisfactory number or to standard, but one of the major downsides of globalisation is that employers no longer have to bother training their workforce when they can easily ship their parts (or advertise their jobs) elsewhere without hassle. If Brexit means companies are forced to invest in their workforce and maximise assembly chains for efficiency, I see that as a good thing - even if it means a significant hit in the short-to-medium term - both in terms of improving the diversity of skills and routes to employment in individual countries, and greatly reducing the carbon emissions and environmental damage of building just one part of a vehicle. Change for the better almost always requires effort and cost, but as a Remainer who would still vote Remain (much as I have huge issues with the EU as a political and economic organisation) if another referendum were held tomorrow, this video made me wonder if Brexit could, looking beyond the usual metric of 'how much profit was made', have a positive effect on the way companies run their businesses for employees and the environment.",dhbibaw,6a1ozt,6a1ozt,0.000309654,-0.999380691,Against,09-05-17
18620,6,xelah1,"It really is a very distributed industry, at least across Europe. About 80% of UK made cars are exported, and about 60% of the parts are imported. And the UK also imports a lot of cars - it's not sensible to make every model in every country, after all. Equally, Europe-wide scale helps manufacturers compete with, say, US carmakers with US-wide scale.When engine blocks go from Italy to Germany to be coated, I'd hazard a guess that the factory doing the coating is also coating a lot of other things coming from and going to other places. Similarly, a car part made in one place might end up in a dozen different models (maybe different manufacturers) assembled in several different different countries for different markets. And each of *those* factories might use a different set of parts with different overlapping use, etc.You *could* argue that it'd be more sensible to try and concentrate all of the manufacturing for all of the parts and models in one place (and I think we know where that would be....). I'm not so sure why that hasn't happened in Europe, but it's not so hard to think of candidates. There may not be enough suitable labour in that place - and even with freedom of movement most people don't really move around very much, even within a country. (I don't see training as a complete solution - individuals' own interests, skills and motivations mean you can't just manufacture an unlimited supply of a certain kind of car-loving worker). It may be cheaper to do final assembly of certain models near certain markets. It make be historical, based on manufacturers who began a long time ago in a much less integrated industry. It may be governments trying to hang on for symbolic reasons. It may be that some capital-intensive or knowledge/research-intensive processes benefit from being in certain environments, and labour-intensive ones in another. Let's also not forget that many parts may be quite small, and certainly easier to transport than a whole car.Either way, I think we know that if it came in to existence such a centre would not be outside the customs union.",dhbjewa,dhbibaw,6a1ozt,1.41E-05,-0.9999719,Against,09-05-17

18624,6,tweeglitch,"This is an idiot idea. Trade negotiators need knowledge of international trade law and processes and particularly the regualations in both countries that apply to the most important sectors they both trade in. For example Canada has experience in negotiating its own trade deals. After ten years it closed one off with the EU. CETA. As part of that deal Canada was granted duty-free exports of 64,950 tonnes of beef and veal. But there's a stumbling block on the use of antimicrobial treatments to remove pathogens like E. coli. Canada also exports meat to the United States where there is a zero tolerance policy for E. coli. That means the entire carcass is treated with antimicrobials in Canadian packing plants to avoid the risk of losing the US market. However some of those treatments are not approved for use within the EU. But if they turn off such interventions Canadian exporters run the risk of having an incident at the U.S. border. Canadia is seeking to service two markets with conflicting regulatory regimes, the incompatibilities are such that producers must choose to service one or the other.  Meanwhile, European meat suppliers have wide open access to Canadian markets. In spite of their experience and ten years in negotiating this deal Canada didn't spot this one. This is what the UK is up against. And the UK has no experience in negotiating international trade agreements. http://www.producer.com/2017/03/canadian-export-officials-miffed-over-ceta-import-regulations/So I give this idea a thumbs up because post EU exit I will still be living in an EU member state.",dhbsx2n,69wf8m,69wf8m,0.74824938,0.496498759,Brexit,09-05-17

18630,6,Shanyi,"Appreciate the comments, everyone. I'm not pretending to have any sort of manufacturing knowledge, hence my surprise at the circuitous route taken to get one cylinder block made. I wasn't necessarily arguing that absolutely everything has to be done in one country - again, given my self-admitted lack of knowledge on the subject, these thoughts are purely reactive - but the sheer amount of travelling the blocks had to do, sometimes for what seemed like relatively small things (coating in Germany), made me wonder if the ease and low cost of moving these parts around encouraged this sort of practice, rather than looking at what possibilities might be feasible in their home nation (be that the UK, Germany, France, etc) or biggest market, then making decisions about what they'd have to go elsewhere for. In other words, making it slightly more difficult to ship parts around - just slightly - might ultimately encourage manufacturers to become more efficient in their processes, even if going overseas is still sometimes preferable (haven't got the right machines, severe shortage of skills, etc), giving workers a little more power and perhaps cutting down environmental costs as well. However, as everyone here has mentioned, there are many complex factors (such as /u/xelah1's point about smaller parts being easier and perhaps more environmentally friendly overall to transport than whole cars) in play which I was/am unaware of. Appreciate all your clarifications, since I'm just spitballing in reaction to the video. I'm not isolationist or protectionist at all, but globalisation has caused the wages of the poorest to go down, so to avoid the likes of Le Pen and her ilk coming to power, it seems some changes need to be made.

18631,6,Scalextr1x,"I sympathise with the motorsport company and their concerns over the delay that Brexit could cause to their supply chain.  I have worked in supply chain my entire career and I was an import/export groupage freight forwarder both before and after the UK joined the customs union.Prior to joining customs union, to make an export or import you had to file a bunch of paperwork, in triplicate.  If you made a little error, it all had to be done again.  Even then, if customs got a bug up their arse, they might hold the vehicle for up to two days, if that happened, they would then be smashing parts or confiscating them and the shipments would end up only partially filled or un-usable.  Then there are tarrif codes to consider, everthing you moved had to be tarriff coded, and this set the levels of taxes and duties to be paid.  We as forwarders would often pay our customers duties on their behalf, this meant we had to use huge sums of capital on VAT deferrment accounts.  If you dont have a VAT deferrment facility with a clearing agent, then you have to pay all taxes before the goods are released by customs, this causes other costs like demurrage if you dont get it done quickly as there isnt much storage space at border crossings.  Oh yes and the queues at crossings could sometimes get huge at busy periods. Thats crossing the border, just one time.When free circulation came in, it was like a dream come true, no awkward documenation, no delays, no screaming customers with broken deadlines.  The customers had to file intrastat codes instead of tarriff codes, but its not necessary to make a shipment, you just keep records and submit to HMRC so international taxes can be assigned correctly.If we are going to leave the EU, which it seems we are, there is no room for this 'no deal is better than a bad deal' BS.  If we have no deal, then we will be even worse off than before customs union.

18720,6,jumble-sale-dude,"Sigh. I've done this many an occasion on this sub so here goes again. I'll start with the obvious: - Immigration. Before you say ""argh you're against migration! Racist bigot etc"" it is important to state that I totally believe in immigration and it is essential for the economy. The problem is the current system is fucked beyond belief and the EU don't seem to give a crap. Open border and freedom of movement - yay great for the average European from a less wealthy and prosperous nation, not so much for the British worker when you have thousands of people flooding in daily. But ""what about all the skilled workers that add to the economy?"" You might say. Well I'm sorry but they are few and far between the numbers of welfare migrants that have flooded here for benefits, schooling and the NHS. I have Romanians rooting through my bins on a weekly basis. I'm sorry but I don't want these people here unless they are contributing to society. And don't get me started about the EU clubbing together to impose mass migration from outside the EU (I live in a city which took in the highest number of Syrian migrants outside of London, it's no picnic let me tell ya! The area I grew up on has now been ""ghettoised""). This bat shit system has also in turn effected:- The NHS. has been crippled with mass migration. Waiting times of over 5 hours in my city. I don't care what anyone says, this isn't the cuts, it's quite simply the volume of people and the system not coping. Oh and while the Â£350 million thing was probably utter bullshit, savings will be made nonetheless.- My child was denied a place at the Catholic school in my area that I attended as a child due to (and I have it in writing) the ""prioritisation of migrants"", so yeah, that sucks pretty badly.- My city has become overrun with Roman gypsies and pickpocketing is now uncontrollable. My Mum had her purse pinched and the police told her straight up that they can't track the perpetrators because most of them are nomadic and pretty much untracable.- I work in Financial services and the EU has a stranglehold over the regulations like you wouldn't believe! Absolutely EVERYTHING is enforced by the ECB, even down to the Mortgages that are sold since  21st March 2016. It has made my job horrendously difficult to keep up with over the years. Anyone who says the EU don't have any sway over our laws and regulations are talking absolute nonsense. Also I seen how the Euro currency has caused problems up close and personal within my job. The single current across different degrees of the economy doesn't work and with the insistence of low inflation from Germany (cough, dictators, cough) this has caused many problems across Europe. Take Spain  and Greece for example - both seen extraordinary high wage growth and labour costs rose above 30% whilst in Germany it declined slightly. This caused a major imbalance and countries like Spain and Greece were left with a major competitive disadvantage. Because of EU regulations not allowing them to make exchange rate adjustments they were left in the shit.- I do most of my travelling outside of Europe, so having to sort a visa to jump over to Spain is a very small price to pay for me.- It is not stated enough that you can support Internationalism and Brexit together. They are not incompatible. The EU embodies an anti democratic and insular outlook. Fortress Europe is deeply illiberal and inhumane. I find that ""progressive remainers"" should not get away with labelling Brexiteers as nasty and bigoted. It is a monumental myth. Juncker and Tusk are deeply uninspiring, unpopular and arrogant apologists for the status quo (one being an ex politican forced to resign over a spying scandal in Luxembourg). I find it greatly satisfying that the UK voters pay them no heed whatsoever and give them the lack of acknowledgement they deserve. And as for the experts, they can state until they are blue in the face that it will be hard work, and it probably will, but to my knowledge, there isn't a single expert with the foreknowledge necessary to state whether it will be a good or bad result.You did ask for details.

18733,6,RidingRedHare,"Thank you very much for the details.The story about a large number of Syrian migrants does not seem plausible. As of late 2016, the UK overall took in only 4500 refugees from Syria. Most likely, a significant number of foreigners from other countries are living in that part of your city. People are notoriously bad at figuring out where foreigners came from. My wife sometimes gets harassed for being Turkish, but she it not Turkish at all.Then, why did an influx of migrants even lead to ghettos? The city where I live has 28% foreigners (including more than 40,000 Turkish citizens) plus another 14% children of immigrants. But yet there are no ghettos. Meanwhile, my home town had a small ghetto when I was young, because the local administration foolishly decided to turn a whole city block into a large homeless shelter. 40 years later the crime rate in that block is still rather high.The NHS has sucked for a very long time. I got NHS horror stories from my UK based coworkers 15 years ago. I would not attribute that to migrants. The Polish migrants which make up the bulk of recent migrants in the UK have a very low unemployment rate. They pay taxes. They thus pay into the NHS. The migrants in the UK that have a relatively high unemployment rate are from outside the EU, such as female workers from Bangladesh and Pakistan. Can't blame the EU for those.The number of actual refugees in the UK took is too tiny to affect the NHS. Rather, the main problem is that the UK only spends 7.3% of GDP on the NHS (already low for OECD countries, and expected to decrease over the next few years), and that is not nearly enough given that this is a single payer system. And quite a bit of that money was wasted on failed large IT projects.Germany took in 1.3 million refugees over just two years, but yet waiting times for most doctors are pretty short. German hospitals have some waiting times (still much smaller than NHS waiting times, though), but that is because they are understaffed, and they are understaffed because they don't pay much and thus have many unfilled positions.Not getting a place for your child at the school of your choice sucks.Pickpocketing is up over here, too. The main perpetrators are North Africans, such as Moroccans and Algerians. Those have no legal right to stay, they cannot get asylum or refugee status, they know they will be sent home, and thus they have very little to lose.The Basel Committee of Banking Supervision is the source of the restrictions that affect the financial sector, the Basel accords. The BCBS is a global organization not related to the EU, the EU only implements the Basel recommendations. The UK itself is a member the BCBS, you will still have all those regulations and limitations after Brexit.Financial services then were impacted by the big financial crisis. The taxpayers had to bail out banks for hundreds of billions, Â£400 billion in loans and guarantees alone from the 2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package, albeit some of that could be recovered. The rules and restrictions serve to reduce the risk of such events happening again. ",dhgko7d,dhggfc1,6ag7xu,0.999999998,0.999999996,Brexit,12-05-17

However, because the Tory majority in Parliament was so small, once the unexpected Leave result happened, the relatively small number of hardcore Tory eurosceptics were gifted a disproportionate level of influence. Now TM, like her or loath her, is widely regarded by those in the know as a very pragmatic and canny operator with a good head for strategy. She is also at heart a centrist. She well knows that a lot of compromise will be required to secure a good Brexit deal, and here's the rub,  the biggest obstacle to securing those compromises will be the hardcore eutosceptic minority on her own backbenches.

The combined GDP of Ireland and Northern Ireland is approximately â‚¬225 billion.

18843,6,tweeglitch,how is it practical for a trade agreement not to have some form of dispute settlement mechanism? Not practical at all and it is the presence of such that makes the deal mixed competence and so one  requiring national ratification. This ruling means that anyone wanting to do a trade deal with the EU without going through all the EU's national and regional parliaments must let the ECJ settle disputes (massive lol).http://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-court-trade-idUSKCN18C0YAhttps://www.rte.ie/news/brexit/2017/0516/875513-trade-deals-ecj/http://delano.lu/d/detail/news/new-ecj-judgment-has-implications-eu-uk-fta/145650https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/singapore-trade-deal-cannot-be-concluded-by-eu-alone-ecj-rules/ And it's all the more irrelevant to the course of Brexit as given the time it'll take to negotiate a UK-EU FTA there will need to be some transitional agreement. This will very likely involve changes to existing EU treaties in the form of a secession treaty (e.g. changes to QMV proportions sans UK) and that will most certainly need national ratification with perhaps a referendum or two here and there.

It was able to do this by exporting to the PIGS (as China did to the USA and Europe).Arguing this imbalance would've happened anyway is irrelevant.The Euro didn't prevent it, probably exacerbated it and has tied the hands of governments by restricting the policies available to deal with it.Additionally, the EU is dominated by Germany which has the most influence over Brussels and is more interested in looking after it's own banks (which lent irresponsibly to the PIGS but now want their bad loans repaid) than allowing the PIGs economies to recover.

Also, the provocative title and her grandiose conclusions could equally be considered disinformation...Data Science will be used to manipulate people so who controls the data is criticalâ€‹ (which is why I choose not to use Facebook or Twitter because I don't want to give them my personal information for free. They'll have to work for it!)I'm not surprised Trump used data analytics to aid his election campaign and I think it worked by reinforcing public opinion against the political establishment while also helping to sway undecided or apathetic voters to vote for him.However, the link between his election and Brexit is that both the result of similar anti-establishment sentiment in the USA and UK. A national backlash against the unequal profitsâ€‹ of Globalisation.It's also worth remembering that while VoteLeave did indeed follow a similar disinformation campaign to Trump, VoteRemain heavily pushed ""Project Fear"".Infact, polls revealed that most people had already decided how they would vote in the months leading up the EU referendum and the eventual result shows how divided the country was over the issue, so AI think the impact of AggregateIQ/Cambridge Analytics was marginal at best. I don't believe the conspiracy theory that Brexit was manufactured by Mercer to facilitate Trump's election win. That's a British journalist using her imagination to delude herself that what happens in the UK matters to American voters!I suspect VoteLeave did (illegally) contract CA to help them with lying to the UK public but their involvement was minimal and they were of limited use/effectiveness. Indeed, Facebook may inadvertently have helped the Leave campaign more!The article also overlooks the overwhelming Remain bias of the mainstream media coverage (of which the Guardian was equally guilty) which further entrenched the Leave vote instead of persuading people to change their minds...Brexit wasn't manufactured by a US billionaire. The vote was predictably split between those who've benefited from Globalisation (in which the EU played a part but, somewhat ironically, Westminster is mostly responsible) and those who haven't. There was also a clear demographic bias in the voting. Older English people, who've never self-identified as European, voted out.

I was mostly referring to the pre-Brexit situation, in which the UK is member of the EU but with asterisks and special-tailored measures everywhere - that is what I called the Extrawurst. (If you though I was referring to the post-Brexit order, then I must have not been clear enough - sorry for that :) )As for whether the EU was better off never existing, and instead remaining a purely trade-orient project rather then going into the territory of political union and (implied) eventual federation, that's just a very debatable topic in which we all have our own convictions and beliefs, and where the debate generally tends to revolve around hypotheticals  (of how much better would it have been otherwise for the contrarians, and of the avoided disasters and bright future of the supporters). I'd love to have that conversation as well - maybe here, maybe another post on this subreddit - we risk running to many parallel threads of discussion here ;). In any case, the EU is there right now, and it still enjoys support in the political mainstream of most member countries - so for the near future it will still be there - else there would be no point discussing these negotiations at all, no?Now, as for the post-Brexit requests that the UK wants, I do not consider them ""Extrawurst"" at all. The UK now has in it's own national interest to extract he best deal it can, and as I said before, such negotiations are exactly where each party goes for the ""I want only that which benefits me"" stance. But do you see how the EU making those ""outrageous requests"" might be just the same? I talk to many of my fellow countrymen back home, and the mood is that ""market access without free movement"" is as outrageous as you feel the Brexit-bill and the economic bullying is: to many of them, it's important that their sons and daughters might migrate, even temporary, to the UK, or get an education here (as I did!), and if that means leveraging the one powerful lever the EU has - it's big market - into strong-arming the UK into something that will allow their children to be better off,  what arguments can you bring to convince them otherwise?  That perhaps our exports will take a negligeable percentage hit if all goes sour?(By the way, do not take this as an attack on the UK - I love this country, I am as happy here as I can ever be, and I am pretty sure even in the doomsday-scenario I'd be allowed to immigrate back given my skillset.

18883,6,StrixTechnica,"It's a complex issue, tough if I'm unwilling to be simplistic about it.The only con is the EU itself and, more specifically, the â‚¬.I think she's done the right thing:* Setting aside those who want to overturn a decision made by the electorate and ratified by Parliament, everyone else is in favour of getting on with it (even if reluctantly in some cases; [only about half of those who voted 'remain' ](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4506710/Rise-Leavers-voted-AGAINST-Brexit.html) refuse to accept the outcome and will do anything they can to block it because reasons).  A strong majority in the Commons means that May can deliver Brexit without too much quibbling over what sort of Brexit is finally settled upon.* In the *exceedingly* unlikely event that Labour should win a 2020 general election, we would only just have left and we'd end up with a government that doesn't believe in the situation and won't make the best of it.  By calling a GE now, May has a bit over 3 years after our exit is effected to deal with the consequences.* In the *exceedingly* unlikely event that Labour should win the June election (perhaps in coalition with the LDs), then they would be in power while there's still a chance to do something about the sea-change of public opinion.* Relatedly, if Brexit turns into the nightmare you seem to believe it will, then May will be forced to own it and make good on her mistakes.I'm not naturally a Tory voter â€” I don't trust them, but I trust the alternatives much, much less â€” so I will be voting Tory in June.Of course.  But the EU need us more than they are willing to admit.  Based on 2007 figures, [five countries contributed half the entire EU budget] (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8036097.stm#start) of which [the UK is the second largest contributor](http://uk.businessinsider.com/brexit-eu-members-net-contributions-and-net-funding-2016-12).  That's going to leave a massive hole in the EU budget that even our exit bill won't plug, not for long anyway.How extraordinary that you should complain that Leavers have been rude to the EU when Remainers have been so extraordinarily rude to Leavers (not to mention the rudeness by some in the EU27).  It's not as if the EU is lily-white or is above any sort of criticism (however conveyed).You are in no position to complain about decorum or lack thereof, particularly when you were less than polite to me about my ""two Egyptian walls of text"".Not that many, tbh.  There are a few laws that are annoying or silly that I would change given the chance, but nothing much of consequence.It's more about what will now **not** happen to the UK after Brexit, namely political and fiscal policy union (which would undoubtedly oblige us to adopt the â‚¬ in time) and the creation of a federal, supranational state.I am confident that the â‚¬ is doomed and will take the EU down, and I don't want to go down with it nor suffer the extraordinary measures that the EC will foist on remaining members before it finally collapses.This gives me no pleasure.  I think that our European neighbours are important and I value an alliance of some sort with them, but not an alliance that resembles what the EU has become.  The EU *was* a great institution and *could* have become greater, but not on its current trajectory.Moot question since there are no EU laws that won't continue to apply after we're out.  Not initially, at least.  That's what the Great Repeal Bill is for.  In time, we'll strip out some the anticompetitive laws to give small entrepreneurs who can't afford â‚¬100k or more a chance and doubtless there will be other changes.I know I won't be popular amongst farmers for saying this, but I don't think that businesses should get any sort of subsidies from government of any sort.  You're either profitable or you're not, it's especially irrational that some sectors (notably farming and fisheries) get subsidies while others don't and it's not the tax payers' job to support businesses that can't stand on their own two feet.And it'll be nice to have our fisheries back.",dhogv92,dgrywd9,66fz4t,0.000487785,-0.99902443,Against,17-05-17

And as with so much in British life, the freedom of movement debate is about class.     Nobody seems to be talking about stopping skilled Europeans working in Britain. It's the working class areas where there's the problem. Traditionally, the British working classes have been both the most tight-knit and most generous-to-outsiders parts of British society. These traits co-exist with a hostility towards employers' attempts to bring in outsider workers to break down locally prevailing wages and conditions. That is precisely what FoM encourages. Of course this rankles. Then there's the churn of people, which undermines local traditions of solidarity and tight-knittedness that characterised working-class life.  For reasons that will become clear,  I'd like to state here that at their peak the British working classes were culturally awesome. After Dunkirk they could have gone 'spend another few years obeying posh idiots who clearly have no idea how to win a war whilst having bombs continually lobbed at us? Aha. No. We're pulling a Lenin: suing for peace and building socialism.' They didn't. As soon as that was over a coalminer from the Welsh Valleys set down a new standard for civilisation in the shape of the NHS, and they voluntarily started dismantling the British Empire. They largely created the world's finest substitute for both religion and war,  namely football; and despite coming from a country the Germans used to dismiss as the 'land without music' they provided much of the soundtrack to the 20th century. They've fallen on hard times. Now, when the burghers of Amsterdam or Barcelona demand and get restrictions on tourism because they feel that the churn of tourists and the economic reorientation of their city to serve them are threatening the culturally unique way of life of these cities, the global bien pensants applaud, even though limiting tourism will inevitably hit GDP. 'Ya, ya, one does not wish such urban jewels to go the way of Venice. Ya, ya, theme park with too many fast food joints and shops selling mass-produced tourist tat.' When the British working classes demand restrictions on freedom of movement because they feel that the churn of EU immigrants and economic reorientation of their towns to serve them are threatening the culturally unique way of life of these places, the global bien pensants go 'you despicable racist scum. Are you brainless turds so economically illiterate that you don't realise this will reduce GDP? This is an act of epic self-harm! Your opinion is completely worthless because you're clearly mentally ill! I demand that the vote be overridden!'TL, DR: there is such a thing as society. Cultural ecosystems can be fragile.

I have a friend who works in Ipswitch as a nurse - she is better off than in Italy. And another one is coming here to work for an IT company. And other like that. And these people's parents/themselves see the end of freedom of movement as a potential dream-crusher - sure, they will not be starving at home, just a lost opportunity.I also appreciate completely your point about the British working class, and the effects that immigrants have on their culture and communities.

18913,6,StrixTechnica,"I already said I don't trust the Tories so I don't trust May, either.  But I trust Corbyn and Farron even less.First, I didn't say that the EU needs the UK more than the UK needs the EU, I said that ""the EU need us **more than they are willing to admit**"" (emphasis added).  Nor did I say that leaving the EU won't hurt the UK.  It may well do, but you're deluding yourself if you think that it won't hurt the EU as well.  Therefore, it's within everybody's interests to set aside sentiment and aggrievement and make the best of a bad situation and strike a deal that is mutually beneficial.FWIW, the UK contributes more than just cash and market demand within the EU and negotiating power to the EU wrt other countries, we also contribute intelligence: *not a one* of the EU 27 is a member of the [Five Eyes intelligence community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes).Anyway, suit yourself; let me know what taxes are like and what shape the national budget is in in 5 years' time, especially if you live in a country that is a net contributor to the EU budget.Second, and this shouldn't need pointing out but just in case, saying the EU needs us does not mean we don't need Europe (as distinct from the EU), it's nations and its citizens.We're not asking you to, we're just asking you to deal with us â€” as I say, in the spirit of pragmatism â€” as the EU dealt with Canada and a few other non-EU member states.Brexit doesn't mean that the UK will have nothing whatever to do with the EU and its member states, it just means that the UK will no longer be subservient to the European Commission.  I'm sure we'll continue to collaborate in a variety of areas after we've formally left the Union.Assuming the EU wants to, that is.  It seems to be a recurring theme from certain quarters that the UK has committed apostasy by leaving the Union and therefore is treated differently from other countries such as (for example) Canada who were never members of the EU.Had de Gaul got his way and kept the UK out of the EEC/Union, do you not think that the EU would have pursued a free trade deal such as that which it recently struck with Canada?  It's ironic for, if [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community#Creation_and_early_years) is correct, de Gaul opposed supranationalism, which is precisely what the EU is turning into.  de Gaul must be turning in his grave.No, it's stating a fact: nothing will change in the UK the day we are no longer a member state.  For continuity's sake, the Great Repeal Bill shall ensure that all of the laws and regulations in place the day before will remain in force on that day, so it is a nonsense to ask what ""laws are [we] happy [we] wont have to follow any more when [we] leave the EU"".What other possible answer is there?Go listen to Mark Blyth's lectures ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S31VLG8Qi78)) on the subject and then tell me that the â‚¬ is still a good idea. Given your aversion to walls of text, I'll let you find out about that on your own if you're so inclined.Sure, but British farming won't disappear without subsidies, but there would probably be a lot of merging of smaller farms into large ones without them.Funny you should mention New Zealand.  When the UK entered the EEC, NZ lost its preferential trading status with the UK because that was a necessary and unavoidable consequence of joining the customs union.  There was a great deal of hardship caused for New Zealanders and NZ farmers in particular but, some 45 years later, NZ's economy is far more robust and able to deal with world economic crises than it was then or would now have been but for the economic and business reforms forced by that event.I have relatives living in NZ and they tell me that NZ bounced back very quickly from the crises of a decade ago, which should tell you all you need to know about depending on handouts, whether from the government or from other countries.Certainly, but not lies.  The Leave campaign was as dirty as the Remain campaign, and there were plenty of fibs and half-truths on both sides.  Neither of them showered themselves with glory with their conduct.But, in politics, it often requires considerable obstreperousness to change the status quo.  Moderates get ignored because change represents risk so, in order to get any traction, the claims must be grand.  In other situations, ""extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence"" but, in the world of politics and economics, there *is* no evidence to obtain because nobody has a crystal ball.  Everybody, Remainers and the EU included, must make their best guess as to the consequences of change.Sure, including the supranational superstate that I believe is inevitable (or would have been had the UK remained).  If you don't mind that, then fine, but most Britons don't want it.  If that's the consensus direction of the EU 27, that's grounds enough for the split.  Shame it has to be so acrimonious, though.Us leaving probably won't change the fact that we're still one of the world's largest economies (5th or 6th IIRC, certainly top 10) and the business done here matters to lots and lots of people.The value of the UK is not derived from the EU, it's derived from the business done here now and before EEC membership and which was created independently of the EU.Things were bad in the '70s, partly because of poor governance within the UK, but joining the EEC didn't fix that, internal politics did.  In fact, Polish economist [MichaÅ‚ Kalecki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micha%C5%82_Kalecki) predicted what happened in the '70s as early as 1943.  In any case, being in the EEC didn't save us from [having to withdraw from the ERM in 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism#Pound_sterling.27s_forced_withdrawal_from_the_ERM), nor did it save Greece from economic ruin, so I don't see how that's an argument for staying within the EU.Besides, most of Europe was in poor shape in the '60s and '70s.  It was only a few decades after the war and there was a lot of poverty, debt and rebuilding to do â€” though some of the Axis powers had a fair bit of their rebuilding paid for them by the Allied powers!  But for the sacrifices made by the Allied powers and by the UK and France in particular (especially being the first to ""step unto the breech"" and declare war on Nazi Germany after the invasion of Poland), many now-free EU citizens may not be so free.I do, but I'm not prepared to submit to an unaccountable, unelected body like the European Commission for the sake of economic security â€” there is an aphorism that variously goes ""he who would sacrifice liberty for security deserves neither [and will inevitably lose both]"" â€” especially when it is far from obvious or credible to suggest that we cannot do well outside of the EU and *especially* when it's far from clear that being inside the EU has actually done us much good.  It's an unanswerable question: how would the UK be different had de Gaul's veto over the UK's admission to the EEC stood?I agreeâ€”â€”on the contrary, we prefer to maintain a trading relationship which is why we want an FTA in place before exit, but that FTA depends on the political will which seems lacking whenâ€”â€”and many others like you, particularly EU apparatchiks.  Saltiness puts pride before pragmatism, and that's in nobody's actual interests.Brexit wasn't won on the ""lies"" (and especially not the ""hate"") of foreigners, it was won on the back of pride in national and cultural identity (which are not dirty phrases and *certainly* not racism as many Remainers insist) and in recognition that [globalism has served only the already well-off](http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2014/01/FT_COTW124.png) (see [further explanation](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/01/the-story-of-globalization-in-1-graph/283342/)).People all over the world are fed up with diminishing prospects and it should come as no surprise when, eventually, substantial numbers [open their windows and yell, ""I'm as mad as hell and I'm not gonna take this anymore!""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGIY5Vyj4YM).",dhp46y5,dhoo7ry,66fz4t,0.690836472,0.381672943,Brexit,18-05-17

18919,6,gimlet-nosed,"It seems fair, but this talk of furthering interests of the citizens of one bloc against the interests of another seems to completely go against the European ideal. You implied earlier that you felt WTO terms would have a negligible impact on EU GDP, but that the impact on UK GDP would constitute a basis for 'strong-arming' the UK. Well, what if the UK believed that WTO rules would have a fairly trivial, if not negligible, impact on GDP? If fancy economists gibbering prophecies of apocalyptic doom were national laughing stocks? Where is the basis for strong-arming here? Even on pre-referendum trends exports to EU27 would dip below 10% of UK GDP by 2030. I Am Not An Economist (so I'm more likely to be right, ha) but in the absence of embargoes and sanctions I can't see how in 2030 we'd be much more than 2% of GDP worse off in a worst-case scenario than on a no-Brexit scenario. That's one year's growth. Woo. GDP would still be much higher than today. My big worry about leaving the EU is simply that an EU-UK trade deal might 'lock in' some or all of the Single Market's neoliberal policies regarding state aid and competition. If we go onto WTO rules then I imagine that there would be a massive push by an activist state to replicate supply chains to discourage the likes of Nissan from leaving, massive support for R&amp;D, and a ferment of political and cultural ideas after a generation in which politics boiled down to whether your favourite colour was blue or red. The trade deficit with the EU would be hammered, Zombie Thatcherism would be buried. If we're not on good terms with the EU then why care about policing the Irish border at potential cost to the peace process? The border can be policed by one borderpost staffed by a labrador puppy, and EU-standard, tariff-free goods can flood into the UK. EU tax collectors can do one. Peace is more important. Such a scenario might arguably be the best one for Britain, all things considered. But it's not the one I hope for. Britain is offering a close strategic partnership that offers free trade despite our deficit, that offers to defend EU nations in case of war, that shares intelligence about those who seek to commit atrocities in EU territory, that opens up its universities (the best in Europe) to EU citizens via Erasmus and Horizon...

In addition, contrary to your statement about integration.

Our way is to integrate ANYONE who is willing to adhere to our values. And by the way, maybe one day the concept of Gaijin will disappear in Japan, maybe it just takes longer. Nevertheless we should not copy them in this regard. Even in the US, Blacks were not Americans for almost 100 years. They were either niggers or slaves or ""something else"".

I like how you believe the UK is in such a good position that it'll be the EU that crumbles on it's position.  In reality, we're both losing.  And I'll agree that both parties will most likely loosen their stance after all is said and done.  In terms of changes, not much has moved yet.  The real change will only occur in 2019 - and it's really anyone's guess at this point what that change will be exactly.  That'll merely be a divorce.  This change is loaded with political gain.  Like a general election.  It's pretty certain that both parties are at least thinking how changes are perceived by voters, rather than how they're actually economical gains.  Assuming there are no grudges, and political gain is removed after Brexit, it'll take years to find a new deal that's satisfactory for both side and has economic gain on both sides.  More likely, it'll take a decade if not more before relationships between two parties settle.  Most investments are made over multiple years, sometimes lasting decades.  Sometimes they're made on worst case scenario's, sometimes on opportunities or other aspects.  Add to that specific training, and availability of skillset of the work force.

18927,6,StrixTechnica,"Thanks for having the integrity to say so :)Even if other Leavers aren't so articulate, or maybe don't even fully understand why they feel the way they do (I have a very analytical mind and I spent quite a lot of time thinking about the pros and cons of the argument before I voted), it's just possible that they, too, might have good-faith reasons not rooted in lies or malice for voting the way they did.  Exactly the same can be said of Leave voters; for both camps, it was partly an emotional decision about identity, power and prospects.  For the most part, both camps voted according to their own perceived self-interest, too.The penny dropped for me when I realised, one day, that one reason I was (then) pro-Remain was because my EU passport means I can, if I want, work in Europe without a visa.  I didn't want to lose that flexibility, even if I never took it up.Then I realised I was being somewhat selfish and not considering the broader issues and how the argument affected others and the country as a whole, and my thinking began to change.  I'm still being ""selfish"" about it insofar as I'm putting the interests of my fellow citizens (and UK-resident EU nationals!) ahead of those of the EU and the EU 27 â€” but no more than any EU citizen is about their political kith and kin.There were several particular events some years ago (so I now can't remember the precise details) that, taken together, tipped my thinking from Remain to Leave.  As I think I said a while back, when I cast my ballot, I actually said out loud, ""I'm not proud of what I've just done, I wish it hadn't come to this.""I still feel that way.  I would rather not leave the EU; I would rather the organs of the EU reformed in such a manner that the UK could remain but, in my judgement this is impossible because of the premises upon which the EU was founded.Yeah, and that's one very big reason why I want out: the rest of the EU such little respect for the sovereignty of the UK (and I dare say any other given member country).  I profoundly disagree with supranationalism because it's impossible for a centralised government to meaningfully understand the needs of all parts of all member states and, even if it were (and they cared), it's also a virtually impossible task to draw up policy that caters for most of those needs when there has to be one law for all.  That's also true at the national level, FWIW, but at least those needs and issues aren't so divergent as they are across the EU 28.Federalism can work in some circumstances such as the US, but it's an uneasy proposition which is why states' rights v. Federal government is always such a big deal in the USA.Yes but, in Ireland, there's nothing any of you â€” not even the Taoiseach â€” can do to change an EU-imposed law or regulation.  MEPs can't even introduce legislation of their own, they can only veto the initiatives of the Commission!National governments implement some truly bone-headed policies sometimes, but at least we can throw out our national government and there's (relatively) limited damage that any one government can do that the following government can't reverse.  But once the EC acts, there's generally no going back for the foreseeable future.May might be bad or dangerous, the Tories might be untrustworthy, but the electorate exercises a degree of control over them that, however slight, is still much greater than the zero control EU member states and citizens alike exercise over the EC.I can't begin to worry about that, nor can May &amp; co begin to plan in detail for what happens after we leave, until we know what the disposition with the EU is going to look like, and that entirely depends on Barnier &amp; co.  And I fear that shall depend more on sentiment like injured pride and political expediency than economic pragmatism.Of course :)  I never sought to persuade you to my point of view, I know enough about such things to know that is next to impossible not least because it's not a wholly rational question, there are substantial elements of emotion and personal values involved.But it's good that I gave you cause to think, even if you quite rationally and by your own lights and values, come to a different conclusion from me.  I respect your perspective, even if I disagree with it.In a way, that's a nice metaphor for the problem I see with the EU: between sovereign neighbours, there can be room to differ and room to cooperate the rest of the time.  But between the EC and its subordinates, there is no room to differ â€” those subordinates will do it the EC's way come the end, and the EC doesn't much care for what anyone thinks other than the EC.Right.

Most `experts` seem to be against that view, and Brussel's negotiating strategy seem to certainly revolve on these assumptions, but hey, I am all for considering it a valid opinion. In some sense though, this means there is really nothing to fear from Brexit and negotiations - it's kind of a win-win unless the UK 'caves in'.

Likewise, in theoretic principle, our Queen could decline to give royal assent to a parliamentary bill (though the constitutional crisis that would ensue would make Brexit look like a minor disagreement).  Something similar doubtless applies to every other member state.The catch is that every member state is legally bound by international law to comply with lawful treaties (more on which later).  If those treaties oblige a state to pass a certain law, then they must do so or be in violation of the relevant treaties and agreements.  Nobody, not even the titular nor *de facto* head of state can escape those obligations without the country facing court action or withdrawing from said treaties.

That's one area where EU has a distinct benefit: the EU acts like a second or third chamber of legislature and everybody benefits when it passes good directives that member states wouldn't be inclined to pass on their own initiative.The catch is that member states can't pick and choose which directives to enact and can do little about bad directives.  Two such possible examples include the injunction against differential premiums on car insurance based on gender and the injunction against denying incarcerated persons the vote (that one was actually an ECrHR ruling and we're not departing from the ECHR, but the principle stands).Both of those examples depend on your politics: personally, I dislike sexism (of which gender premium differentials are an example) but, on the other hand, I can also see that risk is a core principle of insurance underwriting.IMO, whether prisoners should be allowed to vote ought to be a matter of public policy for each member state to decide.  I don't actually have an opinion on that one, but plenty here think that criminal activity severe enough to warrant incarceration constitutes a violation of the social contract.  That violation results in the deprivation of liberty, and there is no difference in principle between that and deprivation of the right to vote.The merits of those two cases aside, no member state can enact independent policy based on public opinion on those matters because external authorities not subject to the sovereignty of the respective legislature have imposed those decisions on every EU member state and ECHR signatory.That post cites no sources and it's pretty evident that it was written from a pro-EU, anti-Brexit and very much anti-Tory perspective, so it's not possible to verify all of the assertions it makes, some of which show distinct bias.  None of that is a bad thing, but the post cannot be treated as anything other that political opinion.  To briefly address each heading in that post:Both the UK and the EU 27 have good grounds to be concerned about their expatriate citizens, and it's no surprise that May won't commit to guaranteeing the rights of EU 27 citizens resident in the UK when the reciprocal guarantee is not forthcoming.In practice, I expect both sides to quickly grandfather the rights of expatriates who can demonstrate an enduring and established connection with their adoptive country as at 23 June 2016.  Neither side has any real interest in doing otherwise except to play silly beggars.The question of whether such persons in the UK are technically considered immigrants is irrelevant provided their rights of residency are preserved.  There are lots of immigrants from non-EU member states resident in the UK who enjoy most of the same rights as citizens and many of whom eventually acquire UK citizenship, so this is a red herring, as is the point about the ECJ.  The jurisdiction of the ECJ is considerably subordinate to [*jus gentium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_gentium), [*jus inter gentes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_inter_gentes) and [*jus cogens*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peremptory_norm) and enforced by courts such as the [Internaltional Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice) (aka The Hague) which bind all nations within and without the EU.  Even outside of the EU, the UK is subject to enforcement of formal commitments, treaties and agreements made between sovereign states.There is a good deal more hot air about this than warranted by law.  Where the UK is enjoined by commitments that extend beyond our departure from the EU, those commitments must be met.  But equally, the liquid and tangible assets held by the EU to which the UK has contributed count for something.  To what extent and how those assets might offset committed spending is a matter for negotiation.If the EU want us to pay money to leave, it has to be reasonable about what it demands.  On the face of it, that ought to be relatively straight forward because the EC insists that this bill arises from extant obligations, therefore the EC ought to be able to show the financial and legal basis for each obligation.In practice, it's going to be bloody difficult because of the number and complexity of such agreements, and any attempt to approximate the value of those commitments will inevitably be met with vigorous argument.Much like 2), this boils down to political will and the extent to which the EC will assert ideology over pragmatism.Also much like 2), there is a lot of posturing and hot air involved.  Even Tusk's guidelines state as core principle #2 that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"".  The practical result is that either side could agree to something *pro tem* for the sake of advancing negotiations and then later refuse to agree to everything else without modifications to earlier agreements-in-principle.  Given Madrid's veto in respect of Gibraltar, that is as likely (if not moreso) to come from the EU side as it is from the UK.As a practical matter, Art. 50 obliges the EC to ""negotiate and conclude an agreement [...] setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, **taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union**"" (emphasis mine).  That language makes it effectively impossible to negotiate withdrawal provisions without also making some progress on what that future relationship with the EU will look like, and that includes trade.This is an internal political matter for the EU 27.  As far as everybody else is concerned, [CETA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Economic_and_Trade_Agreement) (the EU-Canada FTA) establishes a precedent for a trading relationship without the Four Freedoms and, at the very minimum, the EU will have a lot of explaining to do if it attempts to impose less favourable terms on the UK than Canada enjoys under CETA.These are purely political and therefore subjective matters.  Reasonable minds may differ, and for every critic and difficulty expounded, there is someone else with an opposite view who can cite examples where those outside the EU can do quite well (Canada, for example).This point presents no significant arguments (certainly not compared with the first four) and thus constitutes a distraction in its own right.  One could quite reasonably take quite a different interpretation from that of u/lessnonsensepls in each of the cited examples.I've not seen anything in principle to change my mind.  All that poster did was articulate some of the obstacles in the way of accomplishing a deal, most of which ultimately boil down to political will on both sides.In other words, if there is no deal by 2019, it will be for want of intent, not anything else.  To that extent, I think that poster is quite right â€” there just isn't the political will within the EC to conclude an agreement because, for them, ideology and political considerations trump Realpolitik and pragmatic economics.",dhpxj4d,dhpss51,66fz4t,2.20E-12,-1,Against,18-05-17
18943,6,gimlet-nosed,"That's not quite what I meant. From a purely UK-selfish point of view I'd say WTO rules/basic FTA would be preferable. There might be a small bit of a material sacrifice, but this is a gambit with a pawn, not a queen, and it would make it easier to rebalance the economy, would spark political and cultural creativity etc. We'd be in a better position in the long run. However, we are not only an island people but part of the European main, and we should aim to be excellent neighbours. As such we should cooperate and solve problems with our neighbours where feasible, even if such cooperation limits our ability to act in some ways. I would prefer the latter, cooperative path. I don't see this as 'putting UK citizens first'. If I were a European citizen then I would think 'hmm, it's really possible that the UK could change its model in such ways it would really undercut and outcompete the Single Market. That's what the Eu constantly worries about. However, my knowledge of the British tells me there is no significant support for such a course of action. In fact, ironically leaving the Single Market could well make Britain adopt a more 'European' social democratic model - - witness the popularity of Labour's ideas. The only way there could be support for a model bent on undercutting the EU is if the Eu somehow became perceived as an enemy. Now, the Eu is snarling about squeezing the British until the pips squeak. I do not feel this approach was successful at Versailles.  I favour a cooperative neighbourly relationship. Moreover, Euro-me sees that such a relationship could potentially solve various problems with other countries. The EEA was conceived as training wheels for EU membership, but I don't believe Norway will ever join. Its law-taking status is an affront to its dignity as a sovereign nation. There's the Swiss model, but law-matching is way too cumbersome. We need some new model for how to relate to European countries that do not want to participate in our political project. I don't think the UK should adopt the Norway Option or the Swiss option; I think we should invent a new British option, and see if Norway,  Iceland,  Switzerland...  would rather adopt the British model.

18944,6,fedepiz,"Thanks for the clarification!To be fair, I haven't heard of anyone afraid of the UK turning into a gigantic business-friendly paradise off Calais - I'll definitely give some though to it. Then again, wouldn't such an option only be desirable for the UK voter if really we get down to some sort of trade-war like situation?Personally at least, I don't think we should say ""Free movement or WTO"", nor I think that is the official EU position - correct me if I am wrong here. I support the position ""Free movement or no free single market access"", for the reasons stated above: EU is a political integration project, free market and free movement are in this framework though as the fundamental building block of integration, granting free market access without free movement to third parties hampers the process of integration by blurring the relative competitiveness of integration, and therefore is detrimental to ""the Goal"" and ultimately not desirable.But I mean, between EEA-like access and WTO there is a large gulf of possibilities - don't you believe we will land somewhere in between? All I am saying is: the EU wants  free movement, the UK wants free access - and the point of negotiations is to see what compromise comes out. And just like my fellow Europeans are very wrong and myopic when they say ""Ah! That damned UK, so racist and stupid"" - a though that, I repeat, do not share at all - I think similarly the view of the Europeans should not be ""Ah, that damn EU, so tyrannical and bullying"". We are each just serving our relative perceived interest.I will definitely concede a point to you though. If the EU is not intended as a project that is aimed at ultimately achieving strong integration and federalisation, then yes, I'd say my position makes very little sense beyond ""spite"" (which I don't feel), and you are right that every member should just strive to find the perfect balance for their own, peculiar needs",dhq2eyp,dhpzkow,6bbc56,0.000140788,-0.999718423,Against,18-05-17
18945,6,lessnonsensepls,"if I may weigh a little bit:This is the exact polar opposite of what is the case, talk about this at length here (with sources):https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/6a8qbm/uk_prepares_to_play_hardball_over_eu_citizens/dhcuyko/The bigger point is not whether some FTA will be agreed - the political will is there on both sides - but rather that such an agreement will take much longer to work out than the 2 years. And what the UK is doing is unprecedented in that it is cutting ties and creating barriers when most all free trade deals have as their goal to do the opposite. This makes the process potentially even more complex than CETA (which took 7+ years). Insisting that the details should be hammered out in 2 years just isn't realistic.This is the argument David Davis made, but its a creative navel-gazing interpretation of the A50 text, which isn't even relevant any more. It also doesn't answer the flipside of the argument, how does one take into account a future relationship if you can't agree on the basics of the divorce terms?The only thing that is relevant is the fact that the EU set out a position early on that exiting means becoming a 3rd country before a new trading relationship can be formed. Personally, I think that's unhelpful. And I also think the current position of only agreeing until everything is agreed is defective. I do expect some movement on that, particularly in regard to citizen's issues.My piece was opinion yes, but I'd be interested in an opposing view: do you feel like the last 11 months were time well spent? If yes, how so? What was accomplished that is going to help the UK transition out of the EU? If not, why wouldn't you consider it an exercise in time wasting on the part of the government?

18946,6,ziemen,"Is this supposed to be satire? I had to read it three times, but still not sure. I think you fundamentally misunderstood some things in Brexit, I'll try to explain it, maybe it helps.The ""compensation"" you are talking about (wondering why you didn't use ""Brexit-bill"" which seems to be quite a common expression in British tabloids) is not a compensation or an invoice or anything like this. It has nothing to do with ""punishment"" or ""making it hard"" for the Brits. It is just the sum of the money Great Britain has agreed to pay in the treaties it signed. Pacta sunt servanda, if you want to break up those signed contracts you will have to negotiate with every member of the EU in addition to the EU itsself. Good luck with that and good luck with having every single EU member's parliament or referendum to agree to the Brexit terms. Of course, the European Union needs clarity on how far Britain is going to comply with its agreements or if they intend to break them, because the whole budget till 2020 was planned with every country of the EU involved, including GB who signed it in the end. Just taken the case GB refuses to comply, the budget needs to be negotiated again before anything else can be done. Of course, many countries, companies and institutions have planned their budget already, counting on GB to ahere to what was signed, and they will want compensation. And what about pensions and money for British citizens working for the EU? And what is with projects GB is directly getting benefits from? Science, security, construction in GB does heavily profit from EU citizens and money. You see, there will be serious problems to work those things out, and as the clock is ticking, I don't see how GB has time for that. So that money is not about compensation for Germany or any other country, it is purely agreements, treaties and contracts that GB has signed. I don't even think 50 billion will be enough, it will probably rather be more than 100 billion that GB will pay in the end.You wrote that Merkel is putting her own interest in front of Europe's interest. It's actually the opposite: Merkel puts German interests BEHIND European interests. Yes, it is not at all good for the German industry that GB is leaving. GB is a huge market and, like you mentioned, the export is quite strong and it will definitely hurt us a lot. And of course, we will have to pay a higher share of the EU budget now Britain is gone which will hurt us even more. But we will deal with it, and in my opinion, the positive effects of Brexit will outweigh the negative effects in the future. Before Brexit, the EU was tumbling: Finance crisis, migration crisis, Britain threatening to leave (and leaving in the end), France and the Netherlands in danger of getting right-wing governours, the visegrad bloc causing problems and trying to destabilize the EU, Austria in danger of getting a right-wing president, TTIP on the way and worst of it, GB blocking every single initiative to integrate the EU further and enable it to solve the problems, Britain always wanting to get a special treatment. To be honest, i was in some ways doubting the whole project, especially with countries like GB, Poland and Hungary making it impossible to make policies that bring the EU ahead.After GB left, the tides have turned quite a bit: GB out so we can finally start to tackle the dangerous finance sector and do something against tax avoidance. Poland and other visegrad countries realizing, that the EU stands up for the Polish/Romanian/Hungarian workers in GB and finally holding back a bit. Many people who tended to vote right realizing, that if you believe the lies of industrial scales of the populists like Trump, Farrage and Johson, you will be fucked and things don't work out the way you were told.People seeing the good things like peace, freedom of travel migration and stability the EU has brought.Now the special kid is gone, we can finally work on the EU, on further integration (especially in military matters, taxes and legislation) and GB won't block it any more.""Brexit cannot be a success"" Juncker said and he is right. GB needs to have less rights than a member of the EU after leaving, and in my opinion we should make a strong point about what it means to leave the EU, what it means to try to negotiate with the EU and that there is no way GB is getting out better than before. We need to statuate an example so no other nation even gets the idea of leaving again. We need to show our members, especially those doubting the EU, that we will stand united against anyone trying to damage our core. When the EU itsself is at stake, we need to make sacrifices and stand together; Merkel has understood that aswell, and she will try to hold the EU together at all cost, even at the cost of German jobs and her reelection. I think you clearly overestimate your country. With a GDP of 2692 b.$ it is nothing against the bloc of 27 EU members with almost 15000 b. $; the finance sector will move to Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt without problems (and we can finally tackle the business procedures in that City of London), there is no industry in GB that the EU depends on (if you have any industry left at all); security issues are organized via NATO. What positive thing or strength does GB have to offer after that? You should realize that GB's biggest strength towards other countries was the membership of the EU and the acces to that huge market. Now that it is gone, I don't see where GB could go except down.For every complex problem there is a solution that is clear, easy and wrong.

18948,6,StrixTechnica,"As you say, the UK's position hasn't been spelt out and we don't know for sure, in full, what the UK is negotiating for in respect of reciprocity of expatriate residency rights.  It doesn't sound like there's much disagreement over the principle of reciprocity but the devil is always in the detail, of course, for example judicial competence.I think we can both agree that expats' rights should be grandfathered in full, at least up to 29 March 2017 when Art. 50 was invoked.But I think the EU is wrong to insist that the ECJ should have judicial competence within UK borders because it is constitutionally problematic for a court not subject to UK law and whose authority derives from a treaty to which the UK is no longer a party to adjudicate affairs within the UK.  That's a long winded way of saying that the ECJ has no legal nor constitutional authority within the UK, not any more than the UK Supreme Court has any authority in Brussels or anywhere else not subject to UK law.I also see no need for it: UK courts are quite capable of enforcing the residency agreement, and the Supreme Court has already shown its willingness to rule against the Government where it thinks it has erred in law, and has also occasionally been known to overturn new legislation that conflicts with other law and agreements governed by it.No conflict of interest or split loyalties need arise because the UK judiciary is more or less independent from the legislature (Parliament) and the executive (Cabinet), and the Supreme Court's function is to interpret legislation in the context of other all legislation, case law and binding agreements.  Parliament itself is subject to UK law, too, and Parliamentary sovereignty does not extend to absolute, capricious power; it cannot act in a way as to violate other laws and agreements.Should the Supreme Court fail to enforce those agreements, there are international courts that stand above both the ECJ and UKSC â€” at least, in terms of enforcement of binding international agreements.I can't see the UK government jeopardising our permanent membership of the UN security council over an immigration agreement, can you?For the remainder of your analysis, some of it I agree with, some of it I think moot and some of it I disagree with.  It's a good, detailed post that is ripe for an extended debate which might not be terribly productive, but if there are any specific points you want me to address, I'll do my best.Is it?  That's not obviously clear to me at this stage.It may well do but [Art. 50 Â§3](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html) specifically provides for extension of the 2 year deadline if both parties feel that good progress is being made and a final agreement just requires more time.*If* there is the political will.That's not *quite* accurate; [Greenland quit the EEC in 1985](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_Greenland_from_the_European_Communities) which amounts to more or less the same thing for these purposes.The UK does not seek to erect barriers â€” we want an FTA if we can negotiate one with acceptable terms â€” but barriers vis-Ã -vis WTO tariffs are the inevitable consequence if such an FTA can't be agreed upon.I disagree: our laws and regulations are already harmonised and will remain so the day after exit.  The rest of it is a function of political will.  Transforming the trade provisions of the Lisbon Treaty etc into an FTA between the UK and EU is much less complex than hammering out an FTA between the EU and a country with which harmony has yet to be established.It *could* be done very quickly, as in the order of months or so, but not without one or both sides compromising red-line principles â€” which just goes to prove that the problem is political, not technical nor legal.I disagree; IANAL of any sort, but I concur with Davis' interpretation.Nonsense; until we depart from the EU, all articles and provisions of all relevant treaties remain binding on all parties.  The text of Art. 50 doesn't lose significance merely because it has been invoked; in fact, Art. 50 specifies what happens *after* it is invoked, so the text of it is very much relevant.Fairly easily: there is no future relationship, so there is nothing to negotiate â€” although I've argued before that I would consider that to put the EC in violation of Lisbon Art. 8.  One function of Art. 50 is to prevent either side from dragging things out indefinitely or one holding the other over a barrel.  It provides only a base line of what happens after invocation.  If things become so dysfunctional that no reconciliation and no agreement can be reached, the process ends in 2 years' time and trading reverts to WTO terms.  It's an incentive to do better, not a stipulation either of the time frame or of what the future relationship shall be.That said, I maintain that the UK must be prepared to accept WTO terms *and make sure Brussels knows it*.  No-one wants this, not the UK and hopefully not Tusk, Juncker and the rest of the EU but if there is no 'none of the above' option on the table, then there cannot be good-faith negotiation because one side or the other has one hand tied behind their back.I agree, but I think it's posturing on their part.  It's low-balling the UK so there is a position to negotiate from and toward something that is actually sane.I disagree because the terms of the divorce bill, the status of expats, Ireland and trade are all inextricably interlinked.  If you set in stone one part of any of that, you limit scope for negotiation for the rest of it.  That makes stalemate *more* likely, not less.Without knowing what preparations Cabinet and Whitehall have been making since the weeks following July 13 (when May took office), I couldn't possibly comment.  I think time for ruffled feathers to settle was wise (even if accidentally so) but, in any case, nothing could happen before the new PM took office, the new Cabinet announced and Whitehall instructed.  I'd say that what matters is what happens post March 29.  u/DaveChild made a valid point that invoking Art. 50 in March when the German elections are not due until September needlessly wasted 6 months but, on the other hand, May was under pressure both at home and from abroad to get on with it.  IIRC, there were intemperate demands from the EC in the wake of the referendum to invoke Art. 50 immediately, which was irresponsible and unstatesmanlike on their part.So often in politics, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't, someone is always going to be unhappy with what you do and how you do it.Even if I grant that it was wasteful (and I have semi-conceded that), it doesn't matter if both parties are willing to agree to extend the deadline before it expires pursuant to Art. 50 Â§3.The question is, will they?  I'm sure the UK would so, if it doesn't happen and there's a disorderly exit, that would seem to be entirely on the hands of the EC.

18960,6,CerysGreen,"Brexit: Merkel profits from the EU breakup http://i.imgur.com/xbTckZ7.jpgAlmost a year ago the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, but even today passions over the matter in Europe have not waned. German Chancellor as well as its government and business put their own interests far ahead of common European interests, striving to drive wedges between London and the rest of Europe.In late March 2017, Germany's Federal Minister of Finance and a close associate of Angela Merkel, Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble, said in his interview to the Financial Times that it is not in the interests of the EU countries to punish the UK for Brexit although they will not endanger the pan-European integration because of that. In April, the German Chancellor herself once again stated during the debate on Brexit in Bundestag that there could be no negotiations on further relations between Britain and the EU unless and until the amount of the compensation for the UK withdrawal from the Union was determined. Merkel made it clear that Brexit would entail severe costs for London. In fact, her statements have Britain and its European partners pitted against each other. Obviously, the Chancellor has got a compelling reason for this emphasis.It is not European integration Mrs. Merkel is worried about; it is Germany's economy with its highly export-orientated industrial sector. Those two countries have close political and economic ties. The United Kingdom is the fifth largest trading partner of Germany. The total amounts of exports and imports between the two countries is over â‚¬127 billion. After the US and France, the United Kingdom is the third largest export market. More than 750 000 jobs in Germany are linked with trade between the two countries. German automakers, its chemical and pharmaceutical industries will meet with heavy losses if the UK market is lost. Another 2,500 companies have their affiliates in the United Kingdom. More than 400 000 Britons are working there. And above that, being the major financial center of the euro zone, London will be excluded from it. It is clear that as a result of Brexit Great Britain will face minimal losses. And just because of it, Merkel firmly rejects such 'charitable' UK withdrawal from the EU. In her effort to compensate for primarily German losses, the Chancellor is absolutely not in a hurry to discuss the post-Brexit future with other EU members, which causes concerns among them. For instance, the UK decision to leave the EU has already had a profound effect on Denmark, the country that is not only geographically and culturally close to the United Kingdom, but also strongly linked with it in the area of trade. Following the lead of Britain, Denmark joined the European community in 1973. And throughout this time, both Denmark and its British neighbor have been the most skeptical members of the European Union, who also refused to use the Euro-currency. The Brexit referendum has not just increased all-European skepticism, but led to the fact that Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and a few other countries have agreed jointly to leave the EU following the example of Britain if Merkel would continue to pursue her policy of non-respect of EU members' rights. In this case, there can be no question of any financial compensation. It is fair to say that some of those countries support social and economic integration within the EU. But of their special concern and skepticism is the fact that the EU, practically ruled by the German Chancellor alone now, is unable to secure the level of cooperation required for solving the EU problems. Economic crisis, rise in unemployment and poverty, as well as, migration crisis resulting from Merkel's policies of multiculturalism - all this leads to the EU breakup. When the United Kingdom decided on disintegration, it minimized all potential challenges that the European Union would have to face in the near future. And why would anyone blindly trust and come after Merkel and Germany as part of the EU? Why should they be economically dependent on Berlin's moods, erasing their national identities?Merkel's policy is driving the EU to the situation where other countries may also leave the European Union in the coming years following the lead of Britain as they would rather develop an equal partnership with the United Kingdom or even join a new association under British authority than obey Berlin's wishes. Now the European Union is fully on track where it will be only Germany and Eastern European members whose maintenance will cost Merkel billions of euros. Nevertheless, Merkel categorically refuses to cooperate more closely with other EU members and even does not try to discuss with them future prospects of the Euro-zone. First of all, she is focusing attention on German business that has agreed to fully support the Chancellor in the forthcoming elections this September, surely, in exchange for Merkel's assistance in making new economic arrangements with London, which will enable the German business to stay afloat after April 2019, that is, after the UK finally leaves the EU. Merkel has met repeatedly with the head of German Chambers of Commerce and Industry (one of Germany's leading industry lobbying groups), Eric Schweitzer. After the meetings the business decided to support the Chancellor. And Schweitzer started to call upon the EU members and those businesses that are linked to Britain to take a tough line in Brexit negotiations with London. At the same time, the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, has consistently expressed the readiness to pay compensation to the EU. But the total payments will hardly amount to Â£50 billion, as called for by Merkel. And the data presents a very clear result: if the original sum of compensation has covered expenses of not only Germany and its business, but also other EU members, then the sum, which is equivalent to even half of the amount initially requested, will be barely enough to support German businesses and help them to adapt to the post-Brexit time. Nonetheless, some British politicians, like Philip Hammond, are insisting on a total payment of over Â£3 billion in compensation, which according to Mrs. Merkel is negligible. Two years of uneasy negotiations will precede the UK withdrawal from the European Union. As the negotiations move ahead, Merkel intends to damage relations between London and other EU members, betting on such inadequate financial compensation from Britain. Merkel's plan is so that in the end, the EU will get practically nothing from Britain while the German business will be welcome to have all the preferences. The forthcoming elections to Bundestag this autumn are the only real obstacle in the way of Angela Merkel. According to the leading political analysts, her main opponent, Martin Schulz, has a real chance to push the current Frau Chancellor out.",NA,NA,6bva0r,0.99999992,0.999999841,Brexit,18-05-17

IMO, this is crazy; Tories have enshrined the no deal idea as a rational option- it meets their ideological goals (achieve free markets asap) but would cause havoc in economy (simple common sense says you just can't interrupt our main export market - EU- and the domestic market - consumer spending - at the same time without significant negative consequences), and if you vote for it then she can throw her toys out of the pram, abandon negotiations and is free of any blame (it becomes the 'will of the people') Some say it's a negotiating strategy; but if so, its a piss poor one - it is widely acknowledged that the UK has a weak hand, and the UK suffers more than the EU from no deal (quantity of negatives focused on UK, vs quantity of negatives spread over 27) Also remember that brexit has been driven by forces way outside our political system over whom we have no control.  (https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/14/robert-mercer-cambridge-analytica-leave-eu-referendum-brexit-campaigns)  And that the way Brexit was delivered has taken us closer to completing all the requirements of a swing to facism (from the 'never again' list derived from holocaust experience) (I'm not saying we'd go all that way; just that it is a terrifying direction for a nation to be taking - a lesson apparently learned by the rest of Europe from watching our weird machinations - http://www.reuters.com/article/us-far-right-europe-commentary-idUSKBN18424R)All of that, combined with the fact that Davis has said the parliamentary vote on a deal would be on a 'take-it-or-leave-it basis' (i.e. if MPs reject, then we leave anyway, with no deal) this means the last chance for any control at all (on the people who've regularly proved them selves incompetent so far, including May - will post some links at the foot of this msg) is this general election. A vote for May gives her and her gang of idiots and influential right wing sponsors a completely blank cheque to wreak havoc for ideological reasons, with no consideration of less extreme perspectives.

18966,6,lessnonsensepls,"The points you make here are legitimate and accepted, the ECJ red line by the EU is deal blocker if seen through that prism. But there are more than a handful of reasons why the Governments preferred approach is a complete non-starter.Some of which have to do with the current political atmosphere in which the majority of MPs are going along with an anti-immigration agenda. Another part of this is the UK's poor record of honouring the spirit of EEA regulations concerning EU nationals today. There is no basis for trust there.Today's manifesto confirms how the conservatives see immigration happening going forward, raising the cost for employers to hire immigrants, while clamping down even further on people's ability to have their foreign spouse join them, as a few examples. EU nationals in a post-brexit world are going to become subject to those much harsher, much more hostile terms. And the UK can easily tweak at the edges of immigration rules and make impinge on their rights in small or big steps, in direct or indirect ways. Any time the UK writes new laws that affect immigrants in some way, a whole range of issues can crop up that can't be satisfactorily dealt with through UK courts. It's unlikely that the EU will have much sway in the matter. It has a hard time keeping the UK in check while it's a full member as it is.JD Portes recognizes the ECJ issue, but suggests the UK continue for a period under the existing regime, with continued EEA regulations being enforced. Then after this period the UK would give all EU nationals the ability to become British Citizens, without having to submit to the usual ridiculous levels of paperwork and costs. But his strategy also involves forcing some EU members to change their laws (because for example, some member states don't allow for dual citizenship). His plan is very reasonable and gets around the issues of judicial competence and fairness, but even this plan would render many people collateral. And it's not even likely that such an approach would be taken. The EU have every reason not to have an appetite to give way to the UK on this. While an EFTA court might work, you still have to wonder why the EU would agree to something other than the ECJ when it's perfectly set up to deal with citizen's rights. Further more, continued ties to ECJ also make re-entry as a member potentially smoother. This is scenario not many people are thinking of right now, but it's not hard to imagine that the UK might feel forced to re-apply either toward the end of a transition phase or after a full exit occurred.In any case, this is an issue with no good answers, which is I why I feel strongly about the inevitability of no deal.I'm curious to know if you acknowledge that as far as expats are concerned the EU's position is the better position, and that as a result of the UK's negotiating aims UK expats have been offered up as collateral? Because only side is talking about continuity of existing rights, while the other side is talking about reciprocity under degraded terms.This is potentially possible but I've seen not a single commentator or expert talk about the negotiation window extending in this way and it's pretty much the accepted view that it would be highly risky as it requires unanimous agreement, unless I'm vastly mistaken about the odds(which is possible). It also seems to require that the negotiation has been progressing on amicable terms, also not a given. The only thing that continues to matter about A50 is that it specified a 2 year window and ends with the UK out of the EU. It's a text that was never meant to be used. The one thing I've learned from legal commentators is how irrelevant the wording of the text is as political realities trump it. All the analysis of the wording is irrelevant. Like whether it can be revoked or not. It doesn't matter. The EU's political position is the only thing that counts. And the position has been consistent from day one. The UK leaves and becomes a 3rd country member before forming a FTA. Nothing about the A50 text changes that. I don't agree with it personally, but there we have it.It's an example, but Greenlands exit concerned mostly one sector and Greenland kept many ties to the EU and pretty much is handed down a whole array of rules&amp;regulations that it abides by. The UK seeks a whole different way of wielding its sovereignty that is incompatible with a withdrawal of that nature. Yes but this is simplifying things in political terms. Barriers are not so much put up, as they already exist for 3rd countries as a result of not being a member. WTO tariffs are only a small part of the equation, it's the non-tariff barriers that will form the bigger problem. The UK is actively choosing to be a 3rd country here and even with a smooth transition to a FTA there will be barriers as a result of the UK not signing up to the rules of the CU &amp; SM. They might be harmonised in some sense at the day of the divorce but it doesn't make it anything less complex. The rules of the single market work because people accept the authority of EU courts and member states tie their laws&amp;regulations to EU regulations and EU bodies. The UK will be writing out every connection to the EU, decades worth of it in thousands of lines of text. It won't be accepting the EU as an authority. It has every intent of changing rules, policies and regulations. It will also likely be objecting to EU bodies, budget contributions and evolving laws flowing from the Single Market. This is complicated on every level, from political to operational, from a regulatory level to a technical level. Etching out all the EU references in UK law while keeping the substance largely the same does not count as harmonisation, it's the enforcement that matters, now and in the future.So yeah, I vehemently disagree that it can be done quickly. Complex agreements by all accounts seem to take 5+ years where politicians are hardly involved and negotiators hammer out the tough details without constant public scrutiny. This 2 year window is too compressed, the politics of it is going to stay in the foreground - which doesn't facilitate the task at hand.But we can get a rough idea what they have and haven't done, and what needs to be done that is clearly not done. There's very little evidence that the UK is well prepared. 1) In March David Davis was asked about EHIC and he said he didn't know, his department hadn't looked into it.2) He was also asked if there was any reporting done on what happens in a no-deal situation and he said no to that too. (the same guy that says a good Gov't makes contingencies for every eventuality3) They've only just started hiring more people to deal with the increased pressures in immigration, but even at that they have no way of dealing with massive changes in immigration that are going to come, deal or no deal. They will have to figure out how to deal with millions of residents and can barely cope with the volume they have now.4) It's estimated that Brexit will see a five fold increase in customs transactions that will need to be processed and the current IT system is not just not able to cope with the volume, it can't handle with the regime changes that being outside of the customs union will bring. There's no chance in hell, no chance whatsoever that there will be a system in place by March '19. They could throw endless amounts of money at that and lock programmers in a room for the next 23 months and they will still not be ready for that.5) Read the conservative manifesto and try to find any kind of detailed plan for post-brexit. It's still describes Brexit with fluffy words about meritocracy and a global Britain and notions of intent. Ask a Brexiteer MP how they envision Brexit unfolding, what trade deals will be explored and what realistic timelines are, how industries will adapt etc. They don't actually really know what the plan is precisely.6) Whitehall is considered to be severely understaffed and struggling with workload, and it's only going to have to deal with what is perhaps the largest project it will have ever embarked on.7) Ask a cabinet minister how they envision the airline industry working on day 1 of no deal. Or how precisely they resolve the issue of the NI border and the Good Friday Agreement. Lots of questions that there has been no real progress reported on.This paints a picture of a wholly unprepared government that doesn't truly know what it is doing. And people should be very worried about that. Everything is being banked on 'if the will is there solutions will be found'.

The Tory threat ('no deal') is an empty one.  The only related lever we have, is us leaving *possibly* causing a recession in the EU.  The EU are ~50% of our export market and they are also our most local markets (so for un-changeable geographic reasons, it makes sense for us to prioritise selling to the EU); due to brexit, our economy will struggle even without any EU recession; if brexit also causes an EU recession, we'll then struggle more (but we are the only part of the EU who would experience the double whammy).

I don't think we're on our way to being Treasure Island; I don't think we're on our way to being a desert island. In 20 years I suspect people looking at economic charts will struggle to spot at what point Britain left the EU. I do hope that the economy will rebalance and we'll have a politics less stultifying than the Thatcherite consensus years though.If Brexit has historical significance then I think it'll be because of its implications for the EU. I think we're at the nub of the debate with your analysis of the EU as political integration project. If the UK has to pay for full SM access then, well, so does Germany, the Netherlands etc. If certain trading barriers are raised against the UK in order to maintain the 'value-addedness' of the SM even if it harms EU prosperity to some extent then that ties the value of the EU membership to these particular trading barriers. I can't see the knowledge that euro-clearing can only take place in EU territory inspiring passionate proclamations of European nationhood in Wroclaw or Faro.Globalisation entails blurring the relative competitiveness of integration anyway. The EU used to have forbidding tariff walls; now they're rather low and places from Canada to Korea have tariff-free trade. The EU-Ukraine DCFTA basically grants three of the four freedoms, but the EU is wary to even grant Ukrainians visa-free travel in Schengen. The deep problem is that trade integration does not and cannot inspire a sense of nationhood. Look, I'm English. Every single year England effectively sends money to the distinct and separate nation of Wales. This does not constitute debt. This does not constitute generosity. England does not expect that someday a wealthy Wales will be able to return the favour to an impoverished England. It gives no higher status to the English relative to the Welsh. (There used to be a TV comedy sketch in which a modern-day German crowbarred into every conceivable conversation that he would like to apologise for his country's conduct during the War. But a sketch in which a Welshman crowbarred in his gratitude for Wales' benefactor England would be bizarre beyond the range of comedy. It's not funny because it's not true.) It's not used as leverage (the only time it might be brought up in conversation is to chide separatists, and this would almost always take the form 'we'd be better off without you, you know (but we don't want you to go.)')From the perspective of economic rationality England's willingness to transfer money to Wales makes no sense whatsoever. However, this sense of solidarity is precisely what allows the intra-UK single market to function. The market is layered on over this basic solidarity. The application of 'market thinking' to this relationship would dissolve it. The same market thinking would dissolve intra-England solidarity too. It's like a universal solvent that dissolves whatever container it is put into.  So, don't think that way. The trouble is that the EU is predicated on the idea that market-thinking can create this sort of solidarity, and that is a catastrophic mistake.I was reflexively pro-EU until the 2015 Greek crisis. The unutterable horror of different nations in the same union grandstanding about Debt and Credit whilst politically and economically humiliating a struggling nation convinced me that the EU as currently constituted is a terrible mistake. The market is never, and cannot ever be, the glue in a political union.You talk about not wanting to blur the goal of integration, but isn't that goal already extremely blurred? 'Ever closer union' for what, now? It seems to me that different regions have different reasons for joining. Crudely, the North wants trade, the East wants a definitive escape from Russian dominance, the South wants an escape from a sketchy record of governance, and the West wants peace. Ratcheting these disparate goals into ever closer union is bound to cause problems. Yet a multi-speed Europe won't work either. The eurozone is too disparate, and countries that are specifically escaping being treated as a satellite of an imperial power won't accept being treated as being in the slow lane by a power that insists on interfering in its society. The only (partial) solution I see is to work with the erstwhile leader of the Awkward Squad to create a new model that provides an optimum trade-off between trade and national sovereignty. The likes of the Scandis and Visegrad can smoothly peel off to join this (for them) more desirable model, leaving many fewer roadblocks to political integration. The problem of the South is difficult because it is precisely the sketchy governance that makes the West refuse to pool debts, but perhaps a 'Southern Euro' could ease many problems. Then the West may just be able to pursue political integration to the point of federal union. I don't see how political integration could happen without the creation of an attractive Trade 'n' Sovereignty model though.The tragedy of how the EU has been reacting to Brexit is that they regard it as a missile pointed at the heart of the European Project. It is that, but it is also the only thing that might save them -- if they could but understand it. ",dhr6ydb,dhq2eyp,6bbc56,3.39E-17,-1,Against,19-05-17

18991,6,fedepiz,"First off, thanks for taking the time with such long and detail responses - I am really enjoying this conversation :)Anyways, I agree with a lot of what you say - the EU is indeed in a state of incomplete half-integration, where all the needs of fraternal subsidisation are there but yet the feelings required to make such transfers palatable to the public are still not there. And I even agree with you that the treatment of Greece in 2015 was not something to be proud of - and especially not justifiable in a future if integration is to be achieved. And I'll go as far as to say that even though European integration is probably the central issue of my ""political framework"", I am also becoming increasingly skeptic that what I envision will one day even arrive, or bear the fruits I wish.So, ""why integration?"" you ask.I believe the main reason for integration is to retain our relative power status with respect to the rest of the world. I'd say that the power dynamics in the last 100 years have shifted more and more away from Europe, and after '45 I'd say we have been mostly relegated to be semi-vassals in the sphere of influences of the USA and USSR. Now, the USSR eventually kicked the bucket, sure, but how long before the situation comes back again? And how happy we our with the friendly influences of our American allies? Maybe I have read one too many geopolitics journals, but I don't think that the optimal way forward is to say ""we will rely entirely on the support of our big friendly ally"". (I want to underline I have nothing against the Americans, and I am very much happy that my Italy fell on the western side of the iron curtain. Then again, for good or for bad, I could retell here innumerable stories of US influence on Italian politics that didn't exactly make it sound like that was a good, healthy relationship between allies).And I contend that a non-politically united Europe will always be vulnerable to such foreign influences, and that ultimately the way to stand up for ourselves (in a very pragmatic, not idealistic and ""nationalist"" sense) is to form one politically united, federal country.This is for me the point of the EU - to be united in the face of the other. I mean, are there many historical examples of a loose confederations of states happily living surrounded by big, powerful neighbors? To my mind, I can recall what happened to the Greek states between Rome and the Successors, or of the Italian states betwen France, Austria and Spain. Or the divided Irish counties in front of the English way back then. And the list continues.Just to clarify, I am not suggesting that if there was no EU, then in a hundred years Poland will be Russian, and that Spain would become the 52nd state of the Union. I am just saying that we would profit greatly by federating and being able to stand up and compete against the others - as opposed to be fragmented and be, individually, unable to compete at all.There are of course other good things I see in European integration, from the benefits of free market exchanges to the ability to go tour around, by I'd say that is the central pillar for me - and I will concede that such benefits are not exclusive of forming a political union. If you disagree with any of my premises, than it's fine - and I'd be happy to be given historical counterexamples to this sad trend of division against unity. And perhaps the difference between the Pole and the Spainyard is too large to make such a union work - maybe if Europe united, we'd look at Yugoslavia-like, not a dream situation! But I bet (and hope?) that no, the differences are not so large to make it impossible or undesirable. But it's just my contention, and I respect disagreement on this point - I for one am myself highly critical, as you can see!",dhrg4ir,dhr6ydb,6bbc56,0.001897058,-0.996205884,Against,19-05-17

19011,6,StrixTechnica,"(...con'd, 2/2)I confess I'm not up-to-the-minute on this subject because I've got too much else going on.  I've read what you've said elsewhere on the subject, but I haven't researched the matter myself.  Even if I had, there is probably a difference between what is on the public record and what the government's intentions actually are.  (The same likely applies visa versa.)  So no, I can't say that I acknowledge that the EU's position is in any way superior because I don't know what the UK government's true intentions are.which adduces nothing at all...Agreed which, once again, points to political will and mutual disposition being the deciding factors, not anything technical or practical.Acrimony requires two parties and if no agreement is reached, especially due to an acrimonious negotiation, then the EU bears at least some part of the blame for that.  Perhaps also the UK, but the EU is certainly not blameless.It matters, but it's not the last word on the matter.  As I said, Art. 50 specifies a base-line, a minimum, it does not stipulate an outcome.I beg to differ, because analysis of the text contrasted with what the politicians involved actually do is the basis for evaluating their performance and conduct.To paraphrase, the EU is superior to and is the master of the UK, therefore the EU's position trumps the UK's position whereever there is disagreement.  Does that not strike you as extraordinary or in the slightest bit problematic?They're entitled to take that view if they wish, but that makes them responsible for the damage done by taking a hard line and insisting on it for two years.Agreed.The difference is that we *are* a member and we are not a 3rd country, therefore the two are not comparable.  Again, it boils down to political will.No, the EU stipulates that we shall be a 3rd country and then, only then, shall an FTA be agreed (in contradiction to Tusk's undertaking to begin FTA negotiations even before our exit provided ""we have achieved sufficient progress on the withdrawal"").It's true that services aren't covered by the WTO and then there's the whole ""passporting"" question but, economically speaking, I can't think what's more significant than free trade and services.  What other sort of international economic activity is there?There are lots of other, non-economic affairs to consider, of course, including military and intelligence coÃ¶peration.It doesn't make it simple, but of course it makes it less complex than the situation when starting from dissimilar regulatory environments.I'm sorry, but that's a complete red herring.  Many non-EU countries, notably the US, do brisk trade with much of the EU without the oversight of the ECJ.And replacing it by some international agreement or treaty that will be subject to the jurisdiction of the WTO and other international courts as appropriate.Correct.That's pure speculation, at least to the extent of trade with the EU.  Even if we do relax rules, companies that wish to trade with the EU will still have to comply with EU regulations just as other non-EU countries do.  I don't see the problem with that.  And those companies who don't trade with the EU (eg those companies that deal exclusively domestically which includes a lot of small businesses) have no need to comply.Of course!  That's the whole point (or a large part) of Brexit in the first place!  A lot of people, including a lot of businesses, want *out* of the jurisdiction of the EU because of the red tape entailed.  The more that the UK streamlines regulation, the more attractive the UK becomes as a place to do business and development.I don't think you're giving sufficient credit in terms of product and trading standards.  After exit and regardless of the terms of trade between the EU and UK, the standards are still harmonised.  Yes, those standards undoubtedly will diverge with time, but that's no different from other non-EU FTAs such as CETA.I said it *could* be done quickly and also that to do so would require abandonment of red-line principles, therefore it won't be quick â€” and also that this proves the problem is political.  You seem intent on laying this situation at the feet of the UK, when the EU is at least equally to blame for any failure.I'm not prepared to make such speculations but, contrariwise, nor am I going to argue that we are well prepared.Nobody promised Brexit to be easy.Hah!  Manifestos are aspirational at best and hardly worth the paper they're written on and even if it were otherwise, I would not expect to see detailed plans published there.I would not expect even May or her Cabinet to be able to answer that because the answer depends entirely on the attitude of the EC.Even I can answer that: aviation is governed by [ICAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization), the [1944 Chicago Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation) and the [Freedoms of the Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedoms_of_the_air) enshrined therein.  Completely independent of the EU.  How do you think non EU carriers operate into the EU?with which the EU had little to do, so I see that as a matter between the RoI and UK as independent sovereign states.  Despite membership of the EU, the RoI *is* still a sovereign state competent to negotiate such agreements without the oversight of the EU.Remember, the UK is excepted also from the Schengen Zone, and the RoI/NI border is therefore an anomaly born of political expediency.I don't really see why the RoI/NI border and the GFA should pose a problem.  We managed in terms of border controls before either country joined the EEC and I can't see why we can't manage again afterwards.  The primary difficulty will be those who live on one side of the border and work on the other but that, too, ought be soluble: it's no different in principle from non-British EU residents of the UK.  The same means of grandfathering EU rights could be used for this, too.In fact, I don't see the need for any border controls at all, even though we'd be perfectly entitled to impose them even now as an EU member state (no Schengen, remember?)  After all, the lack of border controls is no impediment to enforcing employment restrictions on non-EU citizens.You presuppose that *any* government could do better than this one and that the difficulties and costs (which nobody denied!) are grounds not to leave a political alliance that no longer suits the UK.But you're right to be worried about whether there's a will, because I'm not sure there is.Especially not on the EU side, as the party spurned.",dhs6fvj,dhqpxvm,66fz4t,2.04E-12,-1,Against,19-05-17
19012,6,StrixTechnica,"(1/2)Which somewhat illustrates my point about political will.  Both sides want to dictate terms to the other, that's par for the course in any negotiation, but the EU appears to bring ideology to the table where (I hope) the UK brings principle that affords some degree of flexibility instead.I recall Bill Clinton saying, in an interview (long after he left office), something to the effect that the difference between principle and ideology is that ideologues come to the table with their mind made up and are generally unwilling to consider anything incompatible with their ideology.  In contrast, those guided by principle come to the table with a set of objectives in mind but are somewhat more willing to be flexible consistent with their principles.Such as?  I'm unaware of any skulduggery in that respect, which is why governments, especially local governments, complain about the costs of unfettered numbers of migrants (and EU citizens *are* migrants; migration is not synonymous with lack of residency rights, even if they frequently go hand in hand.  I, for example, am a British citizen who grew up abroad and migrated back to the UK as an adult citizen with the full rights associated.)Careful, that invites scrutiny of how trustworthy the EU has been.  I don't trust the EC one iota (but then again, I don't trust my own government either so perhaps that's not saying much).I think this comes down to a matter of priorities, politics and personal values.  I see nothing wrong with putting Britons before future non-British migrants; if businesses really can't find (or train) anybody domestically to fill the role, then even Â£2k pa is a small price to pay for the talent they need and is small compared to salaries for highly skilled workers anyway.I also think that the volume of net migration is a problem that Remainers continue to be in denial about, just as you wrote about denial on the part of Leavers.  (Note: *volume*, not migrants *per se*.)  Regardless of where they come from, the Tories are right that current levels of net migration are simply unsustainable.  Quite apart from competition for school places and other public services, one of the greatest crises facing Britons is the ratio of salaries to house prices (to which rents are connected).  Migration puts upward pressure on housing and rents because of over-demand, and it puts downward pressure on salaries in low-skill sectors because of over-supply.  That's a very bad combination, particularly for British youth, most of whom haven't a chance of owning a house without taking on staggering debt on top of their already staggering tertiary education debt â€” and that's before retirement savings or the costs of raising a family are considered.  (The housing market is overvalued so, worse yet for our youth is the prospect of getting stuck in negative equity when the bubble finally pops as it must eventually do.)The younger generation of adults have good reason to be angry about the country we've bequeathed them, though possibly not for the reasons they currently think.That may be true absent an EU residency agreement for those with an established and enduring connection with the UK that grandfathered all their rights prior to March 29, but I don't think you can conclude anything about the government's intentions wrt already-resident EU citizens from its manifesto.Your fears *might* come to pass, but it's by no means guaranteed and provided the UK agrees to grandfather rights, there is little that the government can do to impinge on them because the laws and rights to be grandfathered *already exist* and can't be changed.  That's what grandfathering means.By the same measure, the UK has every reason not to have an appetite to give way to the EU wrt a court that, other than by future specific agreement, has no future legitimacy in the UK.  Furthermore, the UK has no reason to have an appetite to jeopardise UK expats and therefore every reason to grandfather the rights of EU expats in the UK.  I read what you said about this elsewhere, but all that presupposes that the UK government proactively wants to throw out current EU residents.  If they do, then I condemn them because quite apart from the human factors (which are significant enough in their own right), it would be hugely disruptive to businesses and therefore to the economy at large.Equally, you have to wonder why the UK, a sovereign nation, would agree to an organ of an institution from which it is withdrawing â€” particularly when the same institution has said, quite correctly, that it would withdraw other organs from the UK because it makes no sense for EU organs to operate outside of the EU!The EU isn't (yet) even a sovereign state, it's an alliance of nation states bound by treaty together with institutions whose authority is derived from that treaty.  The organs of the EU are supposed to exist to serve the member states but, instead, the EC in particular has become a organism in its own right that seeks to advance its own interests independently of its member states' interests.  It has become their master rather than their servant, and I take issue with the presumption of *special* deference to the EC's wishes in its own right, as opposed to the appointed representative of the other 27 states (which the European Council would better represent than the Commission, anyway).I can very well see why the EC might want the ECJ involved, but it strikes me as a bit arrogant of the EC to presume that the ECJ is *prima facie* the best, only or right choice.  If they want it, they can negotiate for it, but they might find that it would cost them far more than it is worth or than they are willing to give to get ECJ jurisdiction.If they can't negotiate for it, then their only alternatives are to agree on an alternative court or try to strong-arm the issue, which is probably a lot easier from their point of view.  But, if they resort to the easy path, it will prove to the world that the EC is a bully, and no bully can be trusted.Since we can't even foresee how the exit might play out, it's a bit premature to consider re-joining the EU â€” if they'd even have us back!  Even if they did, I'm sure it would be without the opt-outs and exceptions we now enjoy (including keeping the Â£), in which case it would require another referendum to see whether the new terms would be acceptable to the British people.

19018,6,lessnonsensepls,"Appreciation for the difference between operating from principles vs ideology not withstanding, it is extremely charitable on your part to envisage the UK operating on principles while the EU is operating mostly on ideology. Unfortunately on the EU side, this will always be viewed as a very grey area because the (deserved) reputation is of an organisation that leads with ideology. As a litmus test though, imagine if ideology was not a driver, would the current steps taken so far by the EU be any different? I don't think it so.Meanwhile, the Brexit project is a full-blown exercise in ideology in which absolutist ideas about control and freedom justify a direction that puts economic interests and those of 4+ million citizens 2nd to a vision laid out by a a small group of brexiteer politicians who are concocting a very different Britain than the one the electorate had in mind.Case in point, if ideology wasn't a factor on the UK side, there would be a moderate and patient approach to Brexit, involving a lengthy withdrawal in which the UK doesn't fuss over EU regulations &amp; laws &amp; courts effective during the transition. A withdrawal in which citizen's aren't held hostage by either side and every citizen and business gets to plan with surety.There is a long list of examples of UK policies and decisions, some notable ones are the comprehensive sickness requirements that were applied retroactively, guidelines around minimum income thresholds (when income thresholds are not endorsed by EEA rules) and an incredibly rigid and unnecessarily long application process for PR. Basically, the pattern is that of a government that looks to maximize the number of ways it can reject people, rather that provide freedoms to people.Surely you can appreciate the difference between a 3rd country national and an EU citizen, who falls under a framework in which all member states have agreed to treat each other's citizens equally and well. The difference is *hugely* significant.To understand the trust argument, it's perhaps helpful to take up a perspective from any European politician abroad and look at how the UK has behaved in the past 3 decades in regards to the issue of immigration. The UK actively campaigned for the enlargement of the EU and basically sponsored Poland into the EU. Poles take up over a million of the EU nationals here. When Poland became a member, other countries, such as Germany understood that a large influx of immigration could pose problems and imposed caps to manage it. The UK had that same choice but, guess what, it wanted those immigrants. Why? Because at that time they were economically desirable. If you can pick a policy that grows the economy, you do it. This is especially understandable when you consider that the UK thrives on immigrants, they are cheaper. Foreigners are cheaper compared to nationals because you pay less for their education and many of them return home, so you get workers who come here during the time in their life in which they are highly productive and cheap compared. So you make these decisions, but then you don't address the population increase appropriately. The UK organized an economy that exploits immigrants.From mainland Europe this change in direction can only feel rich; the UK campaigned to enlarge the market knowing full well what freedom of movement entailed, and having every opportunity to manage the initial influx. But it didn't. It didn't just not manage the influx, it didn't even set up a system to register EU nationals here (and now EU nationals in the UK are paying the price by having to jump unreasonable hurdles to prove they are 'worthy'). And we have UK politicians saying how bad the EU is because it gives 400+ million people access to the UK.In 2012 UKIP starts to get momentum and all of a sudden Conservatives start worrying about immigration. The press starts to focus on it obsessively and now we have a ruling party that has decided to cut immigration as much as it can while endorsing the most draconian policies to affect that goal. A referendum on the EU is waged and it is swung in favour of leave because Leave campaigners endorsed the anti-immigrant narrative (because it worked). At no point have Labour or Conservatives put their hand up and confessed to managing freedom of movement irresponsibly in the past decades. And precious few politicians were brave enough to stand up for the benefits of immigration. They went along with the mood that was being amplified by UKIP and the rightwing press. And now even the more informed voters feel that freedom of movement is some unwieldy, unreasonable punishment done onto the UK because the EU is difficult. It is really quite extraordinary.So you take successive governments who were happy to welcome immigrants for politically convenient reasons, but are now going in the other direction for politically convenient reasons. Citizens of Germany, France, Poland, Spain, they are all being thrown under the bus in the process. From the perspective of our European partners, the optics of this are very bad. It's really quite obscene. Especially when you consider that the UK's attempt at forcing reforms amounted to blackmail (give us special treatment now or we will leave).They can see through the bullshit and see a country that has not just scapegoated the EU for its own failings, but have also it's condemned its citizens as politically convenient targets. They see a UK that has failed with domestic policy and put the blame on the EU and immigrants and is now embarked on an irrational journey with deeply contradictory goals.Don't get me wrong, I can write equally damning accounts of the EU.

19019,6,lessnonsensepls,"I too have no immediate objections to singular policies, like the 2k fee in principle. It's the overall approach to immigration that bothers me and all these policies should be seen in the way a government seeks to treat persons and their rights. Note that there were lots of reasonable ways to better manage freedom of movement as it is, without having to reject it all together. People care about immigrants getting benefits, there was plenty that could have been done to limit that further for example.The 'volume' argument is used very cleverly to make all debate about immigrants sound more reasonable and discussable. Of course it is compelling. But the 'volume' problem isn't the core cause of the UK's problems, which leaves me deeply skeptical about the way people pursue immigration control. Case in point, for a large portion of leave voters, the desire is to keep non-European cultures which are the most threatening to many people out of Britain.Treating immigration as the core problem is a misdiagnosis and it only serves to amplify anti-foreigner sentiments and prop up false expectations. This is dangerous especially when you consider that the UK will always be a country with tons of immigrants.Pressure on salaries in low-skill sectors are weak to non-existent in most categories of jobs, with the oversupply argument discounting the job creation effect that immigrants have (they have hair cuts, go to pubs, etc).http://www.niesr.ac.uk/blog/how-small-small-impact-immigration-uk-wagesAnd this report sees only a marginal positive impact on wages in a post-Brexit world (while forecasting a significant negative effect on GDP per capita).

19020,6,lessnonsensepls,"But the case for that is quite straightforward - ECJ or EFTA courts service the rights of British nationals abroad in an equal way. If the UK aims to treat EU nationals as 3rd country residents subject to UK law only, it can't demand the existing rights of expats in member states continue in any meaningful way. If expats matter this would be not an impossible issue to come to agreement about.EFTA might be a possibility but I think they will stand firm on this because they can. The bully narrative is understandable but a group using its natural position of leverage is always going to be regarded as the bully. A collection of states protecting their interests is also always going to be viewed as a bully if it comes at the expense of a single member state (see Greece). And the UK has long participated in that dynamic when it suited the UK and it will certainly miss that advantage going forward. Note that the bully narrative holds equally to Scotland's desire for independence.Yes, premature to talk about it, but some politicians are thinking about the long game. If I'm the EU negotiator, I would do everything in my reach to limit the amount of barriers that would make that harder to do.Well, I don't understand why, absent having monitored this stuff in detail, that you hold strongly to this view: I've debated the essence of that argument with plenty of folks here and most just run away when I press them with details and sources or pose questions.

It grinds my gears. This has been a much better exchange.I've been following committee sessions and monitoring the accounts of immigration lawyers, legal experts, economists and law commentators on this topic. Some good sources are Steve Peers, Colin Yeo and JD Portes.FWIW while most of my writing scrutinises the UK rather than the EU, it doesn't mean I have rose-tinted glasses or double standards for the EU.

Accepting this dynamic as a natural consequence of the situation does not make it a pro-EU or anti-British view.

19023,6,gimlet-nosed,"It's a pleasure to talk to you -- Obelix was wrong about these Romans! I just have a different emphasis, more on culture than on geopolitical power. Suppose that EU federation is necessary to protect 'us'. Well, who then is this 'us'? It seems to me that a successful and democratic EU federation would require the creation of a European demos, and through this any 'us' would be transformed. â€˜Fortress Europeâ€™ is backfiring terribly. Its insistence on keeping the benefits of trade integration to its members means it struggles to respond to a world in which 90% of growth is predicted to occur outside its borders. Its insistence on keeping prohibitively high tariff barriers for classic 'developing country industries' such as agriculture and textiles surely contributes to mass unemployment in MENA, and thus to political instability and a desperate desire to 'cross the moat' of Fortress Europe. And what is Fortress Europe defending? European Civilisation? What can this possibly mean if Russia and Turkey are firmly on the outside?  Moreover, Europe seems too diverse to work well together as a single unit without grotesquely compromising this wonderful diversity. When discussing eurozone divergence, commentators from the anally-retentive north often essentially say 'why oh why doesn't Catholic Europe just adopt the Protestant Work Ethic???' It would be funny if it wasn't so catastrophic. For me, the EU should drop the ambition of introverted integration and instead exploit its single biggest comparative advantage in this globalising world â€” the fact that the culture of just about every populous part of the world is shot through with some type of European culture and historical links, with the exception of East Asia and arguably even the Indian subcontinent. Europe is effectively a crossroads for cultures all across the world. Instead of trying to be a monolithic bloc it should embrace this role. So weâ€™d have European blocs intensively dealing with those parts of the world they have the greatest connections with, and some inter-bloc forums to link them. So Britain would engage with the Commonwealth, Spain &amp; Portugal with Latin America, the Southeast European Cooperation Process involving the Balkans and Turkey could be enhanced etc. If someone in Guatemala City has a great idea, people in Seville might pick up on it and adapt it for their own city. If successful it then gets discussed in pan-European circles, and someone in the SEECP reckons something similar adapted to Turkish tastes might work in Istanbul. From there it could spread to the Arab world. An idea that might have taken decades to spread across the world, and could have been snuffed out by some vicissitude in Guatemala City, becomes something that contributes to cultures all across the world in an accelerated period of time. In effect Europe would become not a Fortress but a great entrepot of new ideas, picking up the most promising from across the world, adapting them and â€˜trans-shippingâ€™ them to other parts of the world. The cultures of different intra-European blocs rubbing together would probably spark completely new ideas. Europe would have a unique and essential position at the heart of the global economy and enabled to take advantage of trade with all the booming world. Compared to being sicklied o'er with the pale cast of technocracy, the quintessential Spanishness of Spain and the Britishness of Britain etc. might well be enhanced by working so closely with the likes of Mexico or New Zealand, thus enhancing the diversity of the continent. The deadening uniformity of Harmonisation would be replaced by collaboration, diversity and creativity. Such, at least, is my daydream about a different Europe!

19026,6,StrixTechnica,"I see that as a problem, for much the reasons that Clinton articulated.  Ideology begins with what the world *should* be, not the world as it *is* and therefore cannot cope with where ideology leads to undesirable outcomes.Even if it made little difference to the implementation of the vision of the Treaty of Rome set out 60 years ago, I think it'd make a huge difference to the way the EC interacts with its member states, both when Cameron tried to address the UK's concerns late 2015 early 2016 and now, as the UK negotiates its exit.I don't see it that way, but reasonable minds may differ.  My ideas, and those like me, about freedom and who holds power are principles, values at worst.  Here's one way to discern between principle and ideology:Ideology begins with a concrete narrative containing specifics about the world that apparently explains observable facts without much regard to whether the narrative is actually true, and then sets about effecting changes to conform with what that narrative says ought to be the case where the facts differ.  Principle, on the other hand, begins with values, and is rarely expressed other than in general terms.  Where the observable facts differ from principle, principle attempts to find out why and then effect changes in accordance with those principles.As applied to control and freedom, I take the view that citizens ought (viz. a value) to be as free as possible to express themselves and live their lives according to their own lights (provided nobody else's freedoms are infringed upon in the process).  Political control curbs freedom and there must always be *some* curbs to freedom, otherwise freedom becomes meaningless.My problem with the EC doesn't begin with any narrative; instead, it begins with what I consider to be overreaching and illiberal behaviour by the EC.  I would have been happy to see that behaviour reformed from within, but there is now no reason to believe that is possible, therefore the only remedy is to bring political control back home to Westminster.  As things are, that requires us to leave the EU.Note that at no point along that line of reasoning is Brexit inevitable; it could have been averted at any time by addressing the observable causes of disquiet that, as things turned out, led to Brexit.Of course, it's much more complex than that because Brexit is also partly motivated by the welfare of the poorest who can't find work or housing and the economic ruin wrought upon most parts of the country outside of the major metropolitan cities (a pattern repeated in other EU countries).  Those concerns were severe enough that even Sunderland, whose economy depends on car manufacturing and for whom Brexit is seemingly against their economic interests, voted 61:39 to leave.What of the interests of the other 61 or so million with closer ties to the UK than the 4 million (whom I assume you mean to be EU expats)?  Why should the former's interests be second to the latter's?Granted, the instigators of Leave may have different intentions from those of the electorate, but they could not have done it without the electorate â€” and politicians who ignore the will of the people do so at their peril.  Labour, in particular, still hasn't worked that one out because the same electorate that delivered Leave can surely depose politicians who forget who put them there, just as it did with the rout of Labour and the LDs in 2015.Standing up for your principles is not the same as ideologically-driven acting.  Standing up to a bully is not the same as throwing your weight around.In the same way and for the same reasons that the EU said that the EBA and EMA would be relocated out of the UK, the UK is entirely justified in insisting that no European authority should have competence within the UK.  That seems perfectly reasonable to me.Begs the question of how other EU members' record compares...BTW, the UK was the 6th largest foreign aid donor and only those six met the UN ODA's target of 0.7% GNP.  Germany was .5% and France .4%.  DFID's aid budget has been a sore point for a long time.  We could have chosen not to meet that target and few others did, so I don't think you have a strong general case for the UK's perfidy *even if* we fell short in some areas.Are we still talking about EU citizens' rights?  Because if you're an EU citizen, at this moment, there's nothing to prevent you from coming to this country or bringing your EU spouse.  If we're not talking about EU citizens, then the point is moot.In terms of access to benefits, nothing in the four freedoms says that a citizen of one EU country has any right to welfare benefits of another.  Besides, one of Remain's arguments was that most EU migrants are here to work, so the question of access to welfare shouldn't arise.I do, but they're both still migrants, just as I am even though I'm also a citizen.  My point was that being a migrant says nothing at all about what rights you enjoy.  I've also expressly argued for the grandfathering of all rights that EU citizens with enduring connections to the UK as at 29 March 2017.So it's okay when Germany does it, but not when the UK does it (eg wrt Romanians)?I think you're overstating the UK's influence.  Enough other EU member states had to want it or not object strongly enough for expansion into Eastern Europe.  The UK hasn't exactly got a record of always getting its own way, as proved by Cameron's miserable failure to renegotiate terms before the Brexit referendum was announced.  To the extent that the UK *has* received special treatment, presumably that was a calculated compromise on the part of the EU because it wanted something the UK and no-one else could offer.Which might suit government, but it doesn't suit the electorate.More to the point, we *couldn't* address such rapid population increase because with the best will in the world, we're a densely-populated and small island (of the major EU economies, only Germany approaches us in density and most of the rest have less than half) and there's only so much new infrastructure you can pay for without crippling taxation â€” particularly during a time of financial crisis (which says nothing about Labour's failure to develop infrastructure before the crisis, for which they deserve every criticism).Again, what the politicians knew and did don't always coincide with what the electorate wants, particularly when both major political parties are essentially of one mind on the EEC/EU.  Ted Heath brought us into the EEC without consulting us, apparently then knowing the EEC's federalist intentions but perhaps believing that those intentions could be thwarted.  History is proving otherwise.  The referendum of '75 was, arguably, won on lies and even back then was almost as contentious as the '16 referendum.We couldn't.  There were howls of protest when we imposed limitations on Romanian immigrants.  Again, you overstate the UK's degree of control.And if we had, there'd have been howls of protest against what Machiavellian plans we had for such registries!  Besides, there was no reason to suppose then that things would degenerate as they have, and the right time to introduce such a registry was in 1973.  Any later would have been interpreted a sign of bad faith on our part.(cont'd)",dht1kxm,dhsdb98,66fz4t,0.002036325,-0.99592735,Against,20-05-17

Remain likes to tout immigration and particularly xenophobia and racism as single most significant influence on Leave voters, but that's [just not the case](https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/epop/files/2016/07/Clarke-Goodwin-and-Whiteley.pdf).  That paper points to many significant factors including economics, security, foreign affairs and sovereignty. This is corroborated by [Lord Ashcroft's poll](http://lordashcroftpolls.com/2016/06/how-the-united-kingdom-voted-and-why/) which suggested that immigration was the principle concern for only a third of leavers with half citing sovereignty.  My reasons fell into the latter camp â€” sovereignty â€” together with fears of where the EU was going politically including fiscal policy union and a vehement objection to supranationalism (which I see to be a gross insult to those killed in the two World Wars amongst other things) and fears over the macroeconomic soundness of the â‚¬-zone.The motivations for Leave voters were complex and varied and, unless you want to suggest that the majority of Britons are racist (as some have), it's far too simplistic to hang it all on immigration.So this is an example of a difference in values.  I don't see anything wrong with being proud of British identity, nor with letting that identity organically develop without the influence of immigration in numbers greater than can be assimilated into British culture.Some would call that racist, but I call bullshit on that.  I grew up in a country where race relations were poor and politically fraught, *far* more than it ever has been in the UK.  I know how divisive it can be and what happens when one culture is told that it is worthless, and not always the same culture either.  It is exceedingly destructive and demotivating, not to say highly disrespectful.For at least the last two or three decades, the only race, ethnicity or cultural identity of which criticism is not only permitted but sometimes lauded is white anglophone culture.  Various reasons are given for that, including guilt for past transgressions.  Some of them are overtly racist in themselves.Although there has always been racial conflict in the UK since WW2, for the most part most people are at least prepared not to object to immigrants provided they integrate, which is exactly what's not happening now and hasn't been for some considerable time.You may disagree, but I can at least accept that as a valid concern even if I don't always agree with how it is expressed.Note that I'm not saying that your perspective is wrong â€” in fact, I'll state plainly that I think it's a perfectly legitimate perspective â€” but many Remainers insist that valuing British distinctiveness is tantamount to racism and xenophobia.The paper you cite doesn't seem to support that conclusion, it only says that the depression in wages, percentage-wise, is not at parity with the rise in semi/unskilled job competition but, so far as I know, nobody claimed that it did, only that increased competition decreases wages (which that article confirms).It's insufficient to consider gross wages, especially amongst the lowest percentiles.  For the poorest, accommodation accounts for half to two thirds or more of their take-home pay, and that portion of their income is economically inactive, ie it doesn't create economic demand to any significant degree.  Broadly speaking, it either reduces liabilities or increases capital, mostly of private landlords given how little social housing stock there is left.  (And, to my mind, the housing benefit bill pouring so much of taxpayers' money into private pockets like that is deeply problematic.  That's Thatcher's fault, nothing to do with the EU, but little has been done in the intervening 25 years to rectify that mistake.)Therefore, in order to properly evaluate the impact of immigration on wages, it's necessary to look at change in disposable income.  I don't have the data to hand to make that analysis but, if we estimate that only 10% of the poorest's income is disposable (and it's less in many cases, especially pensioners and *especially* female pensioners), then that 1.8% depression is potentially magnified to 18%.  That's horribly inaccurate, but the best I can do with derivative data.but the jobs created are largely low paying and it's not clear that the number of jobs created compensates for the increased competition in the job market.I guess we'll see.  Economic prospects will depend entirely on FTAs agreed with both EU and other countries, and I say that acknowledging that, by definition, FTAs take away jobs as well as creating them, but it's an unavoidable consequence of the neoliberal, globalist environment in which we now inhabit.To pick up on your earlier remark about the UK's core economic problems, one systematic/secular problem is the dominance by capital over labour and Thomas Piketty's (in)famous R Then, Kolecki's Profit Equation kicks in which, briefly stated, says that economic activity depends on capital holders much more than on wage earners.  That, in turn, exacerbates anaemic economic growth because the wealthy spend much less of their total income on consumables, thus depressing demand.  There's only so much that rich people can consume, so the rest of it goes into asset management (eg housing).But economic activity also depends on demand created by a sufficiently well-off working and middle class, both of which are fast on the decline (see the elephant graph and *The Atlantic* article I linked a while back).Housing is an area in desperate need of redress, beginning with the use of UK real estate as investment vehicles rather than places to live.  It's also used to launder money because real estate can be owned by a foreign company without declaration of who the beneficial owners of that company are, and the identity of the beneficial owners is not public information in every jurisdiction.",dht3fu8,dhseu48,66fz4t,1.59E-10,-1,Against,20-05-17

This is pure and simple an exercise in which the UK pushes the blame &amp; burden onto the EU and EU nationals, because it is politically convenient. On what level are politicians taking responsibility for the UK's policies? They're not.This is just a bizarre statement. The UK has been given special treatment at virtually every step of the way. Single Market = UK idea. Rebates asked, rebates gotten. No Euro, no bailouts, no schengen. Host the capital of EU banking, housing of EMA and other bodies. Critical decisions and policies have widely gone in the City's favour. Opt-outs on social policy and the charter of fundamental rights.

19041,6,StrixTechnica,"There is absolutely nothing intrinsic about reciprocity rights that requires the ECJ.  For UK expats, the ECJ is a perfectly reasonable vehicle (being resident in EU jurisdiction), but not for EU expats because, as I said, the ECJ has no other future legitimacy in the UK.  You (and the EC) might *want* the ECJ, but that's a far cry from justifying it.  It's conceivable that different courts could oversee reciprocity rights in the UK and EU, but I don't think that would be a good thing unless precedent between the two courts are mutually binding.  But *that's* a problem because of the fundamental differences of common law and civil/Napoleonic/Roman law in which *stare decisis* doesn't exist in quite the way it does in common law.That, by the way, is a pointer to inevitable political union: we've been running fundamentally different jurisprudences in parallel since 1991, and the tensions created by those differences can only get worse.  The only solution is to leave the union or abolish common law (because, of the 28, only the UK and the RoI use it) and replace it with a new judiciary and new jurisprudence, throwing out nearly a millennium of law and precedent in those countries, including such fundamental law as the Magna Carta (such as it survives, but that's another story).  (That's a great deal more to throw out than the comparatively trifling amount of EU law to which you earlier referred.)In turn, that has serious implications for our constitution and especially the monarchy.  It is hard to see how our constitutional framework could survive without our common law jurisprudence.  If you think Brexit is a mess, it'd be a walk in the park compared to such an upheaval.It cannot be any other way because, as a sovereign state, only UK law and its obligations under international treaties and agreements apply.That does *not*, however, mean that EU expats with grandfathered rights are legally equivalent to 3rd country nationals, precisely because of the rights enshrined in the reciprocity agreement.Of course they can, and by exactly the same mechanism: both the UK and EU would be bound by an international agreement which, whatever other changes to EU and UK law might occur, retain protections for those with grandfathered rights.I agree and, perhaps naÃ¯vely, I expect it to when they get down to it unless the EC decides to ideologically assert the ECJ as a *sine qua non*.  From my perspective, that is intransigence wholly the fault of the EC.Yes, which, once again, reveals another thread to the story of the power relationships between the EU and UK and, IMO, why we should leave.I disagree: the EC's job *should* be to represent the interests of the EU 27, not prosecute its own ideology.  If they were prepared to negotiate in Realpolitik rather than ideology, I would not call the negotiations bullying because representing the interests of the EU 27 (in contrast to the EC) is actually in the interests of everyone, including the UK.One of the unique things about these negotiations is that even after exit, we still share an awful lot of interests in common.  Absent politics, that ought to make it simpler, but nothing ever is in the world of politics.According to Yanis Varoufakis, the EC deliberately sabotaged what would have been workable means to raise revenues by enforcing tax law in favour of imposing austerity â€” again largely (but not exclusively) out of ideological reasoning.  If it's not already obvious, I see ideological thinking as profoundly dangerous.That's a very reasonable point to raise, but there are several important differences.  First, Scotland is a state but it has not been sovereign for over 300 years â€” at the hands of a *Scottish* king, no less.  Since the Acts of Unification in the early 18th Century, it has been a part of the United Kingdom.  In contrast, the EU is not (yet) a sovereign state at all.Second, although Scotland retains its own jurisprudence and now has its own parliament, it has always been directly subordinate to Westminster since the Acts of Union.  The UK has never been subordinate to the EC in quite that way, it has merely been obliged by treaty to enact laws pursuant to EC directives ratified by the EP.  That's quite a different relationship.Third, Scottish independence is still a real possibility, though I think it would be even worse for Scotland than you think Brexit will be for the UK.  If independence eventuates, Scotland would have to reapply for EU membership in the same way as anybody else and would be obliged to adopt the â‚¬ (meanwhile it could not continue to use the GBÂ£) â€” and that'd be true even if the UK didn't exit in the first place.  And it beggars belief that Holyrood should be content with rule by Brussels while objecting to rule by Westminster.It amounts to this: Scotland has no legal *right* to independence from Westminster any more than Catalonia has from Madrid, where the UK has the right to independence from the EU enshrined in the TEU which created the EU in the first place.I can see why one might see that as Westminster bullying Holyrood, but I don't think they're comparable situations, even if you take the view that Scotland *ought* to have the moral right to independence.  I also don't think Sturgeon's conduct helps the cause of Scottish independence any.  But that, too, is another story.It's worth pointing out that *you* don't â€” can't â€” know what the UK's true intentions are either so I could say that it is equally irrational to presume that the EC's position is the superior.  In another post, you observed that the EC rejected the UK's early days proposition but I don't recall if it is known why.  If it is about detail such as judicial competence, then it's unsurprising that they should reject the UK's position without negotiation.  It doesn't automatically signal that the UK has nefarious intentions wrt EU expats as you seemed to infer in that post.Instead, I'll acknowledge that *because* I don't know what the UK's intentions are, my position *might* be without foundation.  I can only go on what I know, and I don't know of any reason why the UK should want to disadvantage EU expats and therefore I presume, on the grounds of good faith and the principle of charitable interpretation, that the UK will negotiate for reciprocity to protect both EU and UK expats.I'll reinforce that by restating my condemnation of May's government if she actually does have any intention of doing anything short of fully grandfathering the rights of EU expats.I'll take that as a compliment ;)IMO, outrage serves no useful purpose.  This requires a cool head, both in lay discussions like this and at official levels.:)  I'm glad I've proved more reasonable, even we agree to disagree on much.That's good, but you can't expect other people to commit that amount of time.  I've enjoyed our discussions, but I've already committed too much time to them!  I've never been any good at resisting a good debate, however.Glad to hear it.  IMV, neither the May government nor the EC are lily-white, but I do get tired of the failure of disputants to acknowledge the failings of their preferred side, but cognitive biases are only human.  And that goes both ways.I agree.  I cannot fathom why there shouldn't and can't be a very swift agreement.  The security and welfare of expats on both sides are far more important than ideological spats over jurisdiction (for example).I cannot fathom why both sides would not say ""we'll grandfather your citizens' rights in our country if you reciprocate"".  That much could be done publicly and in principle without resolving the question of jurisdiction, and doesn't require a commitment up front, but it forms a commitment when both sides say it (with subsequent negotiations over jurisdiction and other pertinent details as required).If one side is not saying it, I want to know which and why.",dht5oge,dhsgmws,66fz4t,1.59E-12,-1,Against,20-05-17

That agreement would be possible if there is genuine good will on both sides, but the EC was insisted that no state was to talk to the UK about Brexit before invocation of Art. 50 and itself refused to discuss it either.More intransigence by the EC.

19048,6,StrixTechnica,"As I recall it, Labour admitted that they had an immigration policy driven by ideological belief (including multiculturalism) that lots of immigrants were good for the country.  The reason they got the numbers wrong is because they didn't actually care about the numbers because numbers weren't the primary drivers of their policy.That's somewhat beside the point because a) Labour's policy didn't relate to EU citizens, who already had the right to come here, it therefore related to non-EU citizens from 3rd countries (as evidenced by the ONS data referenced below), and b) *my* point is *that* immigration is a legitimate issue, not where immigrants come from.When do they ever?  Labour *still* hasn't taken responsibility for its fiscal policy mistakes.EU citizens get dragged into it as an unfortunate proxy, but I don't know why because until 2013, non-EU immigration was roughly twice (or substantially more) that of EU migration; after 2013 it's roughly at parity but still the thick end of 400k pa in aggregate (source: ONS via [MigrationWatch](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/statistics-net-migration-statistics/#create-graph)).  You're probably right, it's a matter of political convenience.In the end, it doesn't actually matter where they come from, the volume argument still stands and remains valid.Right, which is why I said:.While EMA etc might have been in the EC's gift, I doubt being the capital of EU banking was.  That's private enterprise which is free to move and operate wherever it likes.  Had the financial sector preferred somewhere on the content, there is absolutely nothing that either the UK or EC could have done about it.  Besides, it's not like the UK was the only member state to get given goodies (think Strasbourg and Brussels amongst doubtless many other organs elsewhere).Which benefits the City and the private sector, not the country except insofar as tax revenues arising from their own profitability (at whatever cost to everyone else).Poland opted out of the CFREU, too, so again, we're not unique in getting special treatment.But evidently they were not enough to satisfy the electorate.And what is the EC doing when it says ""our way or the high way"", eg over ECJ competence over residency reciprocity?I don't think we've thrown a hissy fit.  I think that having negotiated the best deal we could, the country considered the benefits and costs and decided that membership was no longer for us.It's a bit colourful and prosaic to describe reasoned objection to membership (which I've articulated *at length*) as a 'hissy fit' just because you disagree with those who reason that way, not to say inconsistent when the EC is at least as guilty of a 'hissy fit' as we are (if at all).Instead, I suggest that the EC decided to draw it line in the sand to protect the interests of all whom they represent, including their own ideology of course, and told us 'take it or leave it'.  We decided to leave it.Call the UK and Leavers intransigent if you wish, just as I call the EC intransigent, but there's no call for projecting derogatory behaviour and intentions on either side.Do not kid yourself that any country cares about any other country if it comes at their own expense.  The UK is no different, and it is absolutely right and proper than we expect our elected representatives to look after our interests on the international stage.Again, here is this strange suggestion that the UK should put others first.  Call it selfish if you wish, but if ""charity begins at home"" then we have an awful lot to do at home before we worry overmuch about elsewhere.The whole point of Brexit is that, collectively, we've decided that the perks aren't worth the obligations (especially likely future obligations).  To want an FTA with the EU is no less reasonable than Canada's CETA, and I don't hear anybody calling them selfish.So in other words, the EU has a migrant problem, partly of its own design (Merkel), and the UK criticises and protests EU migration policy (over which the UK has essentially no influence) for being contrary to the EU's interests; we get ignored (or worse) and then get called selfish when we say 'this is crazy, we want out if the EU won't implement sane policies'?It's just bizarre to criticise the UK for objecting to what it saw as bad policy and then refusing to help when that policy turned pear-shaped.  It just reiterates the problem with supranationalism: diversity of policy is impossible.I'm saying that we can't fix our problems while in the EU, not that leaving the EU will automatically fix them.  I'm also saying that the future direction of the EU, codified in Art. 1 as ""ever closer union among the peoples of Europe"", is unacceptable because I consider supranationalism to be unacceptable.It's not a matter of being nice, it's a matter of irreconcilable values.  If you can't abide by the rules of the club, leave.  It's that simple.  So apparently enough of my fellow citizens agree with me, and we're leaving.I have no confidence whatever that the organs of the EU, especially not the EC, has any mind to reform, therefore I see no choice but to leave.  The irony is that it's possible (*just* possible) that, as a consequence of our departure, the EU might reform in a manner with which we might be willing to live â€” but, by then, it'll be too late.  But I don't hold out any hope that it will because the founding principles (""ever closer union"" etc) are too deeply enshrined in both the TEU and the mindset of the EC.And, as I've said, I am persuaded by Blyth's analysis of the â‚¬ and other political economics, and since the â‚¬ is also enshrined in the TEU, that's not going to happen without another treaty.  I just don't see that happening any time soon and even if it did, the cost to â‚¬Z countries of redenominating would be so phenomenal that they won't do it until forced to (at much greater cost).",dhta5xw,dht3j07,66fz4t,0.004157289,-0.991685422,Against,20-05-17
19049,6,StrixTechnica,"Right, and with good reason.We don't know what life will be like once out, but we do know that certain options are not open to us while in, eg FTAs with the likes of the US, Canada, NZ and Australia.  What those options might turn out to be like won't be clear until we're out, so we'll have to wait and see.If what we're doing now isn't working, and if we can't change the way we're doing it under the current framework, then it's time to try a different framework.  That requires leaving.  We may make a mess of it to begin with, it may go swimmingly.  But doing nothing is a resignation to fate out of our hands, which speaks to the sovereignty issue again.Right, and as I've said before, once out, the EU will no longer be an excuse for politicians to avoid taking responsibility for fixing our problems, and so the debate will focus back on Westminster, where it should have been all along.No, see the documentary [After Brexit: The Battle for Europe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMQXXCiEQnA) which examines the pattern of economic devastation in many of the non-major metropolitan parts of EU, including talking to ordinary people who've witnessed the decline.  Euroscepticism is hardly a uniquely British phenomenon.Agreed, but the EU codifies a lot of that neoliberalist economics.  Even if the EU doesn't create the problem, it certainly doesn't ameliorate it.  This is another example of policy levers that aren't available to us whilst in the EU.  Reclaiming control of those levers doesn't guarantee a better outcome, but not having control of those levers puts our fate in the hands of those not answerable to the British public and whose judgement we have good reason to question (eg over previously mentioned migration policy).  I knew when I voted to leave that we faced the possibility of a diminished economy, but remember that my principal concern was sovereignty.So you say, but I say that not leaving will not fix a single problem nor do we have any meaningful influence within the EU to fix those problems, either.If you want to see it that way, fine, but my ""narrative"" didn't begin with a preconceived, ideologically-derived view of how the UK and EU should work.  It began with looking at how the UK and EU *actually* works, looking at the problems we face and concluding that the EU is no solution to them.You put into a simplistic nutshell some of my arguments, but by calling it a ""narrative"" that ""has nothing to do with pragmatism or principle"" you're implying, if not outright stating, that my arguments are false without actually rebutting them, by which justification you then dismissed my **entire** perspective.  That's rather disappointing.I've tried to be respectful of your views and explain why I disagree with you, but I haven't dismissed you just because I disagree with you.  In fact, I've gone out of my way to validate your point of view where I can.What I say may well be true.  Is not the EC a bully?  Is not the EU a net burden?  Is not the EU ideological and can it be reasoned with?  (In fact, earlier you seem to concede that is is ideologically-driven so you presumably agree that it can't be reasoned with.)  Can we effect reform from within?  We've tried, but experience thus far gives no reason to believe so.  We've got opt-outs, but that's a bandage, not reform, and one liable to fall off in the future.That could be read to suggest that the UK ought to be superior.  I don't think that at all, I just don't think the UK should be answerable to anyone but its citizens.  I'm genuinely puzzled why that should be a controversial proposition.That remains to be seen.  I am sure there are elements within the EU who wish to punish us, but I'll not assume that that sentiment will translate into exit negotiations until there is evidence to think that it will.",dhtc2sl,dht4fh0,66fz4t,6.05E-06,-0.999987891,Against,20-05-17

19069,6,tweeglitch,"phasing in of barriers you say? This doesn't sound very phasey; Italianier, Slemayr and Barnier signed and sent a memo to commission instructing that commission services and agencies should â€œstart considering the practical aspects of disconnecting access from non-public databases hosted by EU bodiesâ€. Information systems such as those related to safety and security imports and exports for example. This automatically would put the UK in the highest risk category re goods and so making exported UK goods subject to the highest level of scrutiny. Do you have any evidence to suggest that a phase approach is even likely or do you base it on wishful thinking?Here are the phases perhaps you should have meant or at least as they apply to [food and livestock entering the EU](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0429&amp;qid=1486817283161&amp;from=EN):1. The ability to export to the EU is not automatic. Firstly, the UK will have to formally apply to the European Commission to be designated as an ""approved country"" in order to be listed on the relevant databases. Or rather re-listed.2. Then each individual business wishing to export has to be inspected and certified as an ""approved establishment"". These procedures alone could take months to complete or at least months in normal circumstances but only then are the businesses allocated an official ""establishment number"" which must be marked on all goods exported to the EU.3. all products, including live animals, must be certified as compliant with the EU's animal health requirements and all other relevant regulation. This goes beyond merely being produced in approved establishments. The operational procedures under which goods are produced (or animals kept) must conform with current EU rules.4. goods must then be accompanied by certificates and other relevant documentation required by EU export regulations. This can mean having to obtain veterinary certificates from ""official veterinarians"", or certificates of conformity from the relevant enforcement officials.5. such goods may only enter into EU circulation via a ""Border Inspection Post"" where they are subject to a series of checks. These may be as straightforward as simple documentation check ensuring all relevant certificates are provided. But can include load verification â€“ physical checks of vehicle/container content to ascertain whether they match descriptions on documents. Checks can also extend to opening packaging to verify contents conform to labelling and goods may be physically inspected to ensure they comply with quality and marketing regulations. Samples may also be taken which can be sent for testing such things as presence of microbiological contamination or pesticide residues. The time taken may vary from a few hours or where samples are taken several days. But only when they have passed checks and been certified as suitable for free circulation can they finally be presented to customs for admission to the EU. Yes that's right we haven't even got to customs and value and rules of origin checks.Given that currently it's as easy for a UK business to sell food to anywhere else in the EU as it is to anywhere in the UK that's quite a significant change yeh.On the Border Inspection Post requirement the nearest to UK for its trade with EU is at Dunkirk. Do you think the French will be happy to spend the millions so as to upgrade this facility to allow for the quintupling of traffic that would need to pass through it if the UK were to maintain it's current level of trade with rest of EU?

19073,6,tweeglitch,"yo bro i'm back like i said; pot of tea and entire packet of digestives consumed. So information. You accused me somewhere in this mess of providing little information. Here comes some more information. You mention IT systems and whether certain systems should be retained or not as if that were the only IT system question Brexit poses; which do we keep and which to uninstall lol. Fuck. Where to begin.Well there are HMRC and port authority customs facilities; aside from IT there is the extra storage and inspection facilities (there ain't even room at Dover less you wanna dig in to them chalk cliffs), finding and employing the extra customs officials with sufficient experience in ROI and valuation checks, updating the customs regime upon which the IT systems will be based but let's just focus on IT systems.HMRCâ€™s customs systems are an essential cog in the machine integrated with community systems providers (cps) scheduling and coordinating the flow of goods in and out of the UK through every one of its ports and airports. Pause and ponderâ€¦ flow of goodsâ€¦ every port. What could possibly go wrong! In addition it interfaces with EU wide security and safety systems: the import and export control systems (ics and ecs) and the other one for fags booze and petrol (emcs). â€˜Eu wideâ€™ ermâ€¦ oops! And it might even still work well enough to continue collecting revenue who knows!The UKâ€™s customs systems cannot be updated in time because there will be no time; itâ€™s not until negotiations are complete that there can be surety and clarity on what the new rules will be. And upon those rules technical specifications can be drawn up for developers to follow. If those negotiations take zero seconds then there is the entire two year article 50 period to make adjustments. If however they take up that entire two years then there is a remaining zero seconds. I would tend toward the latter. An ambitious timeframe for a government IT project wouldn't you think?As well as the lack or perhaps complete absence of time to do this work a further difficulty is that Revenue and Customs are part way through a re-write (alarm bells already) from the existing CHIEF system to CDS so as to implement the plan to be EU wide UCC processes (though not sure how relevant many of them will be post brexit). Re-writes are a huge risk as the existing system has been tested in the field by millions of users over decades. The new system obviously hasn't. This total overhaul however is due for release a month before the UK's currently projected EU exit date just to throw some more chaos in to the mix. And of course leaving the EU wasnâ€™t anticipated when work began on this (oh boy).It will also need to scale for the huge increase in declarations to be put through the system from traders previously used to the ease and simplicity of doing business within the EU whoâ€™ll be cluelessly pushing all the wrong buttons and clogging up tech support.However CDS wonâ€™t be ready in time; government IT projects tend to overrun by years and overspend by billions (NHS Connecting for Health Â£2.3bn originally estimated, after ten years Â£22bn eventually spent while the system is mostly abandoned, Universal Credit Â£2.2bn originally estimated Â£12.8bn so far spent and not sure if abandoned or still in progress) and this isnâ€™t the first attempt to rewrite CHIEF either. So given the near certainty that CDS wonâ€™t be ready this means the existing CHIEF system will still be in use come Brexit time. So it too will need to be scaled and updated to take account of the near upending of the UKâ€™s trading arrangements with every other country and trading bloc on Earth. CHIEF was not written yesterday by teenagers in javascript using node js. It was written in the 80s using COBOL, ICL OS and DBMS (ICL went out of business 15 years ago). Updating this system will be particularly challenging given the reason for the rewrite as opposed to adapting it (the reason for most rewrites) is that CHIEF as HMRC have admitted has become too risky expensive and time consuming to make changes to. This tends to happen as modifications are made to millions of lines of code by a stream of programmers over a quarter of a centuryâ€¦ things tend to get a little bent out of shape.Iâ€™d liken situation to an army on the move (from CHIEF to CDS) about to be ambushed (as thereâ€™s no time to prepare) by an overwhelming force as the environment in which this system was written to operate will be radically altered, everything it currently does, every function point will be under attack from some need for change. And thereâ€™ll be no going back either because when it all goes wrong the build canâ€™t be pulled and the previous version installed because the previous version is the EU model. And what makes this project even more failure prone (if it didnâ€™t have enough stacked against it) is that two years post article 50 notification itâ€™s pencils down whether youâ€™ve finished or not. With other large IT projects you sometimes have the option to carry on until you run out of money or the system under development becomes obsolete (e.g. the BBCâ€™s abandoned before completion digital media initiative superseded by youtube, just under a billion wasted on that). Hard Brexit though brings with it a hard deadline.The absence of any functioning customs system together with EU 3rd country customs formalities being imposed on the other side of the channel will gridlock ports. For example as mentioned in another reply in this thread all agri-goods must pass through suitably equipped and staffed border inspection posts before EU entry and the nearest usable for UK trade is at Dunkirk. Will the French upgrade this facility to take account of the increase in traffic that will have to pass through it so as to allow UK farmers to continue competing with their own due to a problems of the Brits own making? There will be mountains of cows piling up at Dover port and â€˜operation stackâ€™ will become the norm with trucks lining the entire M20 and backed up the M25. This isnâ€™t fixable. Trade will be choked off to a volume and rate as can be handled by a paper system first.Which is all a bit of a problem for a country 60% dependant on imports for its food especially considering those imports will become increasingly expensive with the drop in sterling and especially considering the UKâ€™s food system is highly dependant on migrant labour and especially considering subsidies 55% of the average farm income are unlikely to be continued. The problems are too vast to be addressed in the time available and so hence the reason they arenâ€™t being addressed. There is nothing for example happing to replace the various EU regulatory bodies in medicine, air safety, the chemicals industry and the nuclear industry. Businesses supply chains can't adapt in time and due to the 'just in time' nature of modern logistics (though very efficient under normal circumstances) are highly vulnerable to disruption particularly when sustained over a week e.g. the threat to the food system posed by truckers fuel protest in the UK year 2000.However it wouldnâ€™t surprise me that given the scale of chaos and disruption the UK will face post hard brexit that there isnâ€™t some sort of plan for martial law and food rationing.The UK will starve.Will of the people.",dhtjcdj,dhtfmzp,6bz2fw,0.000310578,-0.999378845,Against,20-05-17

19077,6,lessnonsensepls,"See, these are perfectly good arguments for the desire to leave the EU and I have no quibble with that. The problems I have are  with how the vision is executed, 1) Actual people are going to suffer from the hit to the economy, some families are going to be torn apart, some people are going to have to move country against their will, many families are going to endure more hardships as a result of the process of leaving in hundreds of ways, anticipated and unanticipated. Take access to medicine for example, outside the EU its entirely possible that new medicines won't be made accessible at the same speed as when we are a member. This is why I find the idea that its fine if we millions of people suffer for the remote chance that the UK transforms itself for the btter is not credible enough - especially when it is fully capable of transforming itself while still a member.2) A political class that has been defective for decades isn't just going to change it spots, an especially curious idea when you consider the way it is exiting. It's not like a young adult leaving a parents home finally deciding its time to become responsible for oneself. This is the UK leaving while insisting it has been mistreated and not really owning up to own failings - it's leaving with the same mentality that created this mess. It's strutting to the exit with unrealistic goals and an entitled attitude.3) Reasons for leaving the EU, of which there are good ones in terms of sovereignty, liberty, global trade and immigration controls and the sheer ability to transform economic or social policy, should be scrutinised against what politicians are actually angling for. Take the neo-liberal policies you say are codified in the EU. David Davis and Liam Fox are absolutely intent on fostering the kinds of trade deals that further a neoliberal/globalist agenda. For many Brexiteers that was the plan all along. And every trade deal is an exercise in sharing/pooling/losing sovereignty to facilitate trade and cooperation. It should also be noted that people who are legitimately angry about neoliberal policies/globalism and just a general economy that is shaped by big international companies will be sorely disappointed. To recover from Brexit economically, big international corporations and large trading partners are only going to influence UK policy even more than they do today. One of the biggest reasons I'm still backing EU membership is a recognition of the fact that individual countries are always going to cede influence to the influence of big business. Pair this up with an additional 5 years of Conservatives privatising public assets and encouraging foreign investment, and Brits will find their country being more beholden to foreign and corporate influence than they do now.The EU is actually capable of pushing back and doing something about things like tax evasion and environmental issues, because it has more weight, and isn't as susceptible to lobbying on a national level. There are of course counter examples, but then you look at measures they have levelled against Google and Microsoft, or you look at the elimination of roaming charges and you realize that these things would be far less likely to happen in the absence of the EU.Another danger with post-Brexit Britain is that a race to the bottom is encouraged, farmers will be competing with foreign suppliers that have far fewer standards and cheaper labour, manufacturers won't be able to compete in many areas because again, foreign suppliers could be make things much cheaper. And even in relation to EU countries, as freedom of movement will continue to exist in the EU, European manufacturers will have a serious advantage of the UK with better access to labour and better access throughout the Single Market.And the sovereignty argument was always much fuzzier than it sounded. Brexit doesn't increase sovereign influence, it simply means that the UK's sovereignty will be expressed differently. And as a sovereign country, we will more than likely have less influence among other countries, in a time in history where being able to get things cooperatively with other countries is the biggest currency there is.Well you do put a disproportionate emphasis on how the EU is shaped purely by ideology such that all behaviour can be explained by it. And lots of people do that because it makes leaving a more sane sounding prospect. To see only ideology in the EU without seeing it in the UK's current mode of operating just signals to me that its mostly about rationalising. I could be mistaken, but that's how it comes across. With this example being one of them:Why are you calling the other side a bully over and over? It's an emotive term indicating malice and signalling a situation in which the UK then must be the victim. That's just spin to me and actually to me in a sense is a way of talking the country down. To believe it in means to pretend the UK wasn't a responsible actor capable of making sound decisions, invoking this idea that everything about EU membership was pushed onto the UK.It's fair to suggest that, of course, but being answerable to your citizens means being able to get things done in the context of the environment in which the UK finds itself. And it finds itself in a world economy in which cooperation is everything. And it is always going to be responsible for its economy and its always going to have the EU as its principle trading partner. It's not possible to view this issue purely in terms of how laws and regulations come about or how they are enforced. Fully agree with that. ",dhtmw93,dhtc2sl,66fz4t,8.49E-13,-1,Against,20-05-17

19079,6,lessnonsensepls,"My hunch is that it wasn't spurred by ideological belief, rather the ideals of multiculturalism were just to dress up a policy that was economically advantageous. This is not a uniquely British problem.I'm recalling correctly, the City accounts for 11% or so of tax revenues, so it certainly does help prop the rest of the UK which isn't all that productive. Anything that strengthens the biggest motor in the UK is exceedingly good for the UK.It should be quite clear that to claim that the EU has been unresponsive or ungenerous to the UK's interests would be grossly distorting. That's my point with all of these examples.That was a trap the Cameron set for himself. He was never going to drastic reforms under a UK-determined time line and under the threat of defecting the group. That's not how groups work. A wiser UK strategy would have seen UK wield its influence with member states to build of to reforms that would have benefited other member states. It didn't build consensus in a smart way. That's the UK failing at simple group dynamics - don't even need to bring EU's ideals or agenda into it. If you want to influence a group, you have to be seeking to benefit the whole.It's got good reason to do that. This is the sound of 27 member states prioritising the interests of the group and its members over the interests of one leaving member. This was bound to happen no matter what the ideology of the EU.Which happens to include British expats and people who didn't want to leave the EU.I'm not making that suggestion. I think the UK would be putting itself first by conducting itself in a more moderate way and by not rendering residents political fodder. The UK will gets it FTA and it can do Brexit in a perfectly reasonable way, but there's no evidence its trying to do that, it's pursuing Brexit recklessly and rigidly to the detriment of all, precisely because it is such a precious ideological choice that people fear could be reverted when support fades.Nobody in Europe is calling it unreasonable. A FTA will happen. The only thing that is unreasonable is the timeline in which it thinks it will be possible and some of the illusions that the UK continue to foster about retaining the benefits of membership without the obligations.Diversity of policy does have perks but things like the mass movement of people necessitates cooperation. Not really the fault of the EU, much of the waves of refugees and non-EU migrants is coming as a result of failed Western policy in Africa and the Middle East.",dhtocfs,dhta5xw,66fz4t,0.513729372,0.027458744,Neutral,20-05-17

But his account of his experiences negotiating should be viewed with an understanding of how he approaches politics and economics. He makes analyses that are so striking, too striking I would say. Personally, I would de-emphasise the degree to which things are supposedly operating according to dogmatic commitment to ideology. I think the world is messy and what happened to Greece was unfair but ultimately it was all the other member states drowning out the interest of a single member state that had a lot to answer for. Weaving in dollops of ideologically driven motivation makes the story more compelling and clean, but I think at the end of the day that's just a way to make sense of events. In reality, I think it was a messy pile of **** in which member states decided it was not going to pay for Greece's misfortunes. Unfair yes, but perhaps not much to do with ideology.The question I've asked people is why aren't the UK's true intentions clear? It's quite clear that judicial competence is going to be an argument that won't be hashed out quickly, yet the Government pushed out stories that they rejected an early deal (of which they conveniently didn't release any details) and then went on pretending that a deal could be done by June but the EU dismissed that also. Why is trying to make the EU look bad in this respect? The EU position is out in the open and its goals are to deliver the same rights as expats and EU nationals have now. The UK has clearly different ideas of what rights to protect and which ones to tinker with and how to legislate it and this idea that it can be agreed quickly is therefore a deliberate deception promoted in the papers. The white paper, policy signals*, a supposed list of rights they want to fight about and Junckers account all indicate that they don't want to grandfather existing rights, they want to give EU nationals 3rd country status, ilr, while mirroring the existing rights of non-EU migrants as much as possible. And to the degree that they want to cut the rights of EU nationals, is the degree to which they aim to cut the rights of Expats (without being straight to them about it). The EU's position is far, far more strong and stable.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/may/03/may-expected-to-challenge-right-of-eu-citizens-to-bring-family-to-britain-non-european-spouses-brexit",dhtqkgm,dht5oge,66fz4t,0.065578333,-0.868843334,Against,21-05-17

For example, a company that employs truck drivers delivering all over Europe (but always returning home), or has offices or a warehouse in another country (registered under the foreign company's name), they pay taxes in their home country and can have workers employed on their home wages. There has been a lot of discussion about these kinds of companies, as obviously countries don't want businesses to pay lower taxes elsewhere while operating within their borders, and the limits are quite strict on defining the main country of operations (if activity is evenly split between 2 countries, for example, they must incorporate in both, and pay the respective local taxes and wages). The workers are not idiots, either, most leave as soon as they find something better in their host country. AFAIK, seasonal workers get paid minimum livable wage and pay NI contributions and income tax.This is set up so that everyone gets the same minimum wage, so local companies will prefer hiring locals.

Thus forcing the current position the EU is taking on trade with the UK in the future.  Many cannot afford it cuz their economy, and there are others who are still new to the club and are gainers from the EU budget.For me it kinda shows the UK contributed more that its fair share to the EU project.  Because removing the UK from all the projects, incentives and what ever the UK was given as a member of the EU, actually worked out that brexit resulted in a budget reduction in real terms for the EU.I do not think that ""UK membership fees - UK membership benefits"" is anywhere close to zero.So they are sitting in their meeting rooms trying to come up with ways to extract the budget shortfall from the UK indirectly; post divorce.  And it seems to me they hatched a plan based on trade, member states maybe been told ""If this plan does not work then you'll have to pay up"".

The Euro has failed to bring EU member states closer together economically than they were before they joined it. On the contrary, in the decade since the 2008 crash it'sâ€‹ caused a divergence because of it's restrictive ""one size fits all"" policies and the transfer of monetary control from national governments to the ECB.The Baltic states only joined the Eurozone in last few years. Greece has been part of it for a decade longer (since 2001) and crucially, during the financial crisis of 2008 which highlighted the problems with the Eurozone.If the Baltic economies are currently doing well it's not because of the Eurozone which they've been outside until recently. Infact, it's arguably _despite_ the Euro! If anything, they're evidence that EU members don't need the Euro to benefit from being part of the single market. Obviously, the UK is the best example of this, (as it could've joined decades ago) yet nobody currently claims they made a mistake opting out of the Euro and are worse off as a result.The truth is the UK is a large enough EU member economy with enough influence in Brussels to negotiate an opt out from the Euro while the Baltic states are not, so they weren't offered such an option. Perhaps they also would've chosen to remain outside the Euro, givenâ€‹ the choice...It's not a case of Either - Or. Greece has had structural problems since WW2 (in particular,  widespread corruption leading to overspending), yet despite these cultural and economic problems it was nevertheless invited to join the EU in 1981, and also joined the Euro in 2001 after Goldman Sachs helped ""fiddle their books"" to meet the Maastricht Criteria. Nobody is denying Greece has issues but rather than improving things joining the Eurozone has made them even worse. Why?  Because _there is plenty structurally wrong with the Euro too_!Membership of the EU between 1981 and 2001 benefitted Greece but the Euro has been a disaster. It's still too early to assess the damage as Greece will suffer the negative consequences for decades to come. Except that some policies do more harm than good.  In this case, Austerity is actually causing further structural damage to economies already in crisis. However, even Austerity isn't being enforced equitably. We're already seeing Italy receive preferential treatment to Greece because the EU can't afford the Italian economy to crash as Greece's has done. Greece is a relatively small member state with a relatively small economy so it has less influence in Brussels and less impact on the EU as a whole which is why it's being made an example of.  In contrast, Italy is like the Lehman Brothers of the EU in that it's ""Too big to Fail"".That's an impressive list which overlooks the fact that half those countries only joined the Eurozone recently so it's too early to assess if they've benefitted from it.Also, most of them are small countries with small economies while Spain and Italy are large countries with large economies, so those two groups are more equal in size than they appear when you consider the populations involved.Of course there are differences between the economies of these countries; There always have been. The point of the Euro was to overcome them or at least reduce them, in preparation for a closer political union. In this respect it has already failed.The Euro didn't exist 30 years ago. Spain has benefited from a world-wide increase in living standards and also from being a member of the EU, which helped ensure European economic and political stability during the 1960s, 70s and 80s.However, living standards in Spain have been falling since 2008 and the PIGS in general are worse of now than they were a decade ago.However, over the past 20 years the EU has made a series of mistakes which are now starting to reverse what it achieved in it's first 40 years.

19294,6,TheShreester,"Except it's not just Greece (10 million) that is worse off than before. Spain (55 millon), Portugal (10 million), Ireland (5 million) and now Italy (60 million) and to a lesser extent France (65 million) are all struggling because of the Euro crisis. Ignoring France because it's not yet in crisis, that's 140 million citizens, over 1/3 of the Eurozone population (approx 40%), living in countries which have suffered crises under the Euro. Also, aside from Germany, the rest aren't doing particularly well either. Growth across the Eurozone as a whole is anaemic even compared to the UK and USA, nevermind China, Australia etc. Even Japan looks healthier!How do you explain this?These problems are self-induced by poor governance, but not just as the national level of the guilty parties but also at the supranational level of EU institutions. The IMF has even broken ranks with the rest of the Troika over the handling of the Greek bailout because they recognise that politics, not economics, is driving the decision making. The same now appears to be happening (on both sides) with Brexit.What evidence? By all means provide it of you think it's relevant.Which completely misses the point I was making. Why was the UK treated specially and allowed so many optouts? Because the EU loves the UK and vice versa? I think not! :-DThe UK is one of the largest European economies and an influential political and military force globally (despite being the USA's lapdog when it comes to most Forign Policy decisions). This is why it was given preferential treatment; Because _the EU is an unequal union, always has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future._ The UK wants out because they aren't preparedâ€‹ to share power with Brussels, but we're not talking about 27 other members here, just 2 - France and Germany - who really call the shots. If you examine the voting statistics in the EU parliament the country which has been most vocal in voicing it's objections is the UK (who've actively voted against policies they disagreed with, rather than abstainingâ€‹ as most newer, smaller members do to avoid ""rocking the boat"") and the country which has taken the opposite position the most against the UK is Germany! _This was a good thing_ as they balanced each other out, preventing either country from dominating, resulting in a compromise based consensus. Unfortunately, as evidenced by its FPTP political system, the UK doesn't like consensus politics...I agree. The UK has long had an overly optimistic view of it's self and an inflated sense of it's own importance (perhaps a hang over from Empire days). Brexit will force it to not just ""talk the talk"" but actually ""walk the walk"" and we'll see how it fares without the support of the EU (membership of which I think has been beneficial for the UK, overall).However, the EU institutions in Brussels are equally arrogant and full of themselves. They've monopolised the decision making of the 27 member states by gradually concentrating more power thereby gaining more influence over member states. This is worryingly undemocratic and doesn't bode well for the future, especially as they'reâ€‹ the ones pushing for ever closer union.Generalise much? This is empirically false. Ireland is an outlier. Spain's government was fiscally conservative before the crash of 2008 with some of the lowest debt levels in the EU. Italy has one of the largest, most productive economies despite a significant North-South cultural divide.There is no mystery about which economies are weaker. My point is that the EU granted them membership anyway and later allowed them to join the Euro aswell. Who's fault was that?The fact is that NONE of the original Eurozone countries have kept within the Maastricht guidelines. Even Germany and France repeatedly broke the rules they laid down (regarding budget deficits) and France is currently doing so again. These rules didn't prevent the 2008 crash and haven't helped the Eurozone recover since, so why do you find it so hard to believe that perhaps they need revising?I agree the cause of the current financial crisis clearly isn't the Euro, but then I never claimed that. My point is that the Euro is making it more (as opposed to less) difficult for Eurozone economies to recover from the crash, partly because the rules it imposes are ""the wrong medicine"" for the problem and party because it's been hijacked (by Brussels and Merkel) to pursue political agendas.Arguably,- Maastricht was a mistake- The Euro was a mistake, especially because of the credit boom it created- Allowing Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy to join the Euro without first requiring substantial structural reforms (to bring their economies closer to those of Northern Europe) was a mistake- Pursuing Austerity politics after the 2008 crash, (rather than embarking on fiscal stimulus and debt restructuring) was a mistake- Inviting immigrants with open arms (as Merkel did) without first consulting with other member states or formulating policies to deal with the inevitable influx of asylum seekers, was a mistakeThat's a poor argument considering it took 25 years after the EU was created to invite Greece which still joined 5 years before both Spain and Portugal and 14 years before Austria, Sweden and Finland! It took over a decade after the collapse of the USSR for ex Soviet bloc countries to join (partly to allow some time to pass but also because Germany opposed their membership while it struggled with reunification) and Turkey is still waiting - and probably will be for decades to come...I agree we should accept short term volatility if the long term trend is upward but I disagree that this is what's happening. If you'd asked me 20 years ago I'd have no hesitation with agreeing the EU has been a good thing for Europe overall but much has changed since then and I'm not so sure anymore...

Greece was like a plague without safe currency, at least now it has the safe currency, and Germans are basically constantly funding Greece now. Maybe Greece should consider a higher retirement age then 55 and a more efficient tax system?Because in its heart and soul the UK never really wanted to be fully in it. They always felt that they are something different and better because of their legacy as former #1 power in the world. So they tried to not fully participate in the project.EU with it's ""unequal"" union gives 100 times more voice to small nations like Slovakia, Czech, Hungary, Poland, etc. then they would otherwise have. Let's take other parts of the world with no union. Do Central American nations have an equal voice in the matters of their region compared to USA, Mexico, etc.? Does Philippines have an equal voice compared to Japan or China? Does Lesotho have an equal voice compared to South Africa? Does Bolivia have an equal voice compared to Brazil? Why is your expectation here that Luxembourg would have the same influence as Germany or France?

That ship has sailed, and we will take whatever actions we need today to improve, but Euro and EU are staying. Yes, because present conditions are causing you to think emotionally, and not long term. I am thinking 20,30,40, 50 years into the future, meanwhile you are thinking about NOW. Let's be honest, this immigration crisis is the main idea in peoples head when they are thinking of anti-EU ideas. The #1 cause of problems in the Eurozone was the global financial crisis in 2008 which originated in USA. You always mention problems in the Eurozone but what about the grand ole USA with its dollar ( which some other nations use as primary currency lol ) You had large numbers of people literally bankrupt overnight, thrown out of their homes, owning ZERO. So yes we have higher rates of unemployment in Europe, what do you expect? There is a higher degree of socialism in Europe, it's not work or die like the USA and I for one think it is better that way. Some of this has to do with sheer population size as well I might add. 600 million people in continental Europe in that tiny area with limited resources. I mean what do you expect? USA has 320 million people in an area 2 times the size of the EU, Canada 30 million, Australia 20 million. So they have much more flexibility with this stuff. Anyways, I personally am happy to see UK leave. It is much more ideal to have continental Europe pursue even stronger integration and just leave the British out. I truly believe it was holding the EU back from its full potential and I think this is a good humbling experience for the British. I am also confident they will eventually rejoin, on European terms, as Europeans, not as British. So for now I think best thing to do is just wait this process out.

Its the individual states working together that does this, working together as they did prior to the EU existing.Free trade is the one of the few areas I completely agree the EU is a good club.

19335,6,amgiecorker,"Good points thankyou.  very quick reply.  I don't think 'bribe' is the best description  - its more a member ship fee to access the relevant benefits. your paragraphs 1 and 3, generally, seem to be contradictory (our nation is controlled by others; but each nation has their own control)Health care, I've checked (briefly).  you're right, my language was not exact enough.  but it will cost more; UK citizens will (very likely) have to take out health insurance at much increased cost after we leave, if visiting the EU.  That negative will be increased significantly for anyone with pre-existing medical conditions. protecting citizens, was again, inexact language. basically this is what I mean. The Tories, as per ideology, must be aiming for reduced regulation.  That means things like Renewable Energy, Working Time Directive, EU Climate  control, Temp workers directive are under threat - they cost money, but protect people, and our environment.If you're going to spend money on any of them, its better to do so as part of an agreement with 500 million trade bloc, than on your own (certainly climate change, bigger positive impact then; also worker rights, again, it helps more people if we do it as part of a group).  If we're not going to spend money on them, then our children will suffer (climate change, reduced worker rights).  Consumer rights is another good one; I need to do more research on this one, but logic says, if we're to sell to Europe (and if we don't then we're seriously screwed), then our products (services, or items) will still have to meet EU standards; its just that the EU citizens will be protected but ours will not (most likely it will be a process of gradual deterioration over time of UK rights as the gov unpicks the ones that allow businesses more profit, at the cost of UK consumer protections, and the cost of EU facing business still having to meet the regs - again, if you're going to do consumer protection, it seems much better to do so as part of a club - developments costs, etc, are then shared and everyone in the club benefits)re trade deals, https://fullfact.org/europe/how-many-free-trade-deals-has-eu-done/ is a useful 'landing page' on EU trade deals (mainly noted here so I can find it again tbh).  Generally, they're currently working on some of the same ones that the UK will have to work on, just the UK will be a much smaller prize as a trading nation than the EU.  for example, re commonwealth countries (Tory's empire 2.0 'vision') India and Australia, negotiations EU have already started and Canada trade agreement is done of course; and the EU is more powerful than the lone UK in such negotiations. And the EU is also working on opening up developing countries as well.  so, on FTAs, we seem to be entering a period of replicating work (trade agreements) that others have already done for no extra benefit. In summary, (my opinion) taking back control is still difficult to define (we already seem to have control, and influence); and achieving this nebulous feat will cost us a fortune and reduce our citizen protections.

Also remember, the Tories caused this (before the referendum, ONS stats show the UK massive majority wanted to stay in the EU - Tory press, their manipulations and their lies, caused the negative vote) and the Tory hard brexit is the most damaging one possible to your future. (unless you're super rich).

June 8th is your only opportunity to say no to this. (Brexit is politics now; it will affect all party policies, and all the other parties have less damaging policies towards implementation of Brexit)Why do the 28% (it used to be nearer 40% - some have already woken up) think everything will be fine?

(my note; seems to go against immigration limits, but see below - the UK will be absolutely desperate for trade agreements, and will therefore need to allow cheaper labour from those countries we *need* to get agreements with, where those countries (like India), require such agreements)We will be tied into EU trade agreements for quite a few years (a reminder maybe, this is going to take way more than the two years quoted). Then we'll want our own treaties. Negotiated by Liam Fox, who has strong links with US corporations, and has said that the needs of financial services and banks will be prioritised (i.e. not the needs of UK workforce or consumers). Learning lessons from ongoing EU trade agreements, Ms Kaucher suggests that will result in US agri business putting a lot more Genetically modified food onto our shelves (the EU is protecting us from this, whilst we are members)  (my note, I assume that means some of the safety info which the EU puts on our food, will disappear)That any UK/India agreement, will have India requiring no limits on the number of Indian workers (cheaper than UK workers) who can work in or for UK companies.  (my note, remember we're damaging 50% of our export market here (the EU), so we will be desperate for agreements, and the countries negotiating will be aware that we are desperate - terrible negotiating position for the UK)With China, the EU are after a bilateral investment treaty; only concerned with investment (no consideration of human rights, labour conditions, climate protections, etc) (my note, climate change protections cost money - part of our EU membership goes into them.  it seems likely to be an area where the UK government will wish to save money - climate control efforts have been a joint effort by western economies; if we drop out, why can't they?

19416,6,amgiecorker,"good question; here's a rough (but compelling imo) argument for 2nd ref. It think it's much more undemocratic to plough on relentless, with no further consideration of democracy (Tory's plan - remember they were taken to court to force them to give parliament any say, so its safe to assume that is why they called the election, to get big majority and continue steam rolling the UK). People can change their minds.  A decision made on one day can't last for ever; at what point does it need to be refreshed then?  A good yardstick might be a court conviction; an appeal must be heard if significant new information comes to light - we have loads of new info about options and impacts, and we will be picking up a lot more first hand experience over the next few years. another yardstick might be politics; every four/five (or it appears two) years we get a chance to change our minds.  conditions of exit will be better known three years after the ref, so that's a reasonable amount of time elapsed. but if we vote May in with a big majority, that will be her excuse to ignore any further requests (the will of the people, renewed).  See below; I don't think May would get any majority if voters actually knew the facts (this whole thing was described as just a spat between different sides of the Tory party - illustrates the fact that they caused all this fuss and damage - stats show few UK people were bothered about leaving the EU before the Tories put it on the agenda). And both Labour and Tory are nearly ignoring Brexit in this election (neither have costed it in their manifestos, but its going to cost an absolute fortune in lost gdp and leaving bill, rendering their manifesto promises fairly invalid imo), so I don't see how this election can be classed as a mandate for Brexit - that won't stop May doing so, but again, its a good argument for a 2nd ref once details of a deal are known. all of those points, suggest a 2nd ref in 2019 is almost obligatory, in a democracy.  May won't do that though, so I'm voting tactically to get a mix into parliament who might be able to force 2nd ref. My personal opinion is that there's also a lot of evidence that the Tories (and their backers) attempted to trick the UK into voting out (at least partially hidden, big data firm involvement, the multiple breaches of the editor's code by Tory tabloids, the unified support for positive financial predictions when 90% of economists said economic impacts would be negative etc) and that's clearly had an impact (about a quarter of people still believe that Brexit will have no economic impact, or a positive one - that's clearly wrong).

19417,6,amgiecorker,"Basically, any such confusion or embarrassment is down to the Tories mishandling (i.e. crappy vacuous excuse slogans for them pursuing the agenda of their backers, ""the will of the people"", ""brexit means brexit"") the outcome of the mess they created in the first place.  I've just posted an argument for a 2nd ref which has three parts;  politics lets us change our mind every 5 (or 2) years - 2019 landmark will be 3 years on; so that's a reasonable time frame, especially given the magnitude, to double check (2nd ref) if we've changed our minds;  also like a court appeal, if more info comes to light, the decision should have a chance to be reviewed (2nd ref) - we have loads more info already, and will pick up more primary evidence over the next couple of years; and this general election can't be described as a mandate for anything related to brexit, as the two main parties are (basically) ignoring brexit in their manifestos (i.e. not costing it, when the costs are going to dwarf all manifesto promises), so this election cannot be claimed as a mandate for anyone's brexit (i.e. we still need a 2nd ref).

Granted with a bit of a struggle and it may be some while yet before I can pour cheaper maple syrup on my porridge but anyone with the slightest interest in the topic of international trade or the EU will know itâ€™s a done deal.2. â€œHowever a quirk of the judgement strengthens both the EU and oddly smooths over some of the many Brexit hurdlesâ€Bullshit. The judgement changes nothing and merely confirms the status quo; that mixed agreements require member state ratification. Nor does it alter what constitutes EU and member state competencies. 3. â€œThis spillover of EU's powers in trade negotiation allows the UK to negotiate directly with the EU on a greater number of areasâ€.What does this even mean? The commission has sole competence for negotiating trade agreements. Does the article mean to imply or does the writer wrongly assume without explicitly saying so that negotiations on some matters can be direct with member states? How does this judgement increase the â€˜number of areasâ€™ and in to what areas? Pure bullshit. And it goes on â€œBy being able to negotiate more areas directly and solely with the EUâ€ I mean wtf! whatever the scope of any future FTA the UK may negotiate with the EU it is only the EU commission UK will be negotiating with. Negotiating FTAs is the sole competence of the EU. 4. â€œA simplified and disentangled trade negotiation process is no doubt in the UK's interest for a smooth Brexitâ€Crap. The EU does not want to conclude an FTA during the A50 process so immediately after exit there will be no FTA. What will smooth the exit will be what ever transitional arrangements are agreed. An agreeing this will likely need member state ratification.But the full court opinion is here: http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?docid=190727&amp;mode=req&amp;pageIndex=1&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;text=&amp;doclang=EN&amp;cid=491724The story with Singapore is basically this: commission concludes simple accord with Singapore though includes some member state competencies which will need passing to what ever dispute resolution mechanism was agreed (as of necessity any FTA will do). So Commission goes to ECJ â€œAh come on ffs sake itâ€™s only a diddy little deal and granted itâ€™s mixed but only for these tiny bits so do we really have to drag this through the normal ratification process and risk having the Belgium Wallies or whoever throw a spanner in the works?â€ The tiny bits in question are in the field of non-direct foreign investment (""portfolio"" investments made without any intention to influence the management and control of an undertaking) and the regime governing dispute settlement between investors and States. But anyways the ECJ comes back and says basically â€œyeh I know the ratification process is a balls but that cannot affect who has competence to conclude an agreementâ€. Any regime, which removes disputes from the jurisdiction of the courts of the Member States, cannot be established without Member State consent. Even if a very small part of a treaty is not EU exclusive competence then the whole thing needs member state ratification.This is also old news.

19443,6,fractalvoid,"Hi there I appreciate the feedback and you raise a lot of good points that are not covered as the article is intended for public consumption rather than scholarly, but I believe you have approached the article completely from the wrong end, and I hope to show you why. My numbering relates directly to as a response to the numbering you have made.1)	CETA failed to pass on account of the Wallonian regional parliament ergo it is a failed agreement, I get your point though that it will be pushed through one way or another. Its wrong that you have suggested that all Member States have ratified it, you are possibly confusing signing and ratification which are two different processes although an overlap can exist for sure, at present only Latvia and the European Parliament have ratified it, contrary to what you have stated. Until Ratification is complete the trade deal is not a done deal, in fact in France the deal is under review by its Constitutional Council and Macron himself has pledged to have a review of the treaty before ratifying it.  There are similar issues in other member states. All this agrees with the general premise that it takes only one regional parliament to derail it. 2)	The Judgement does change the status quo, one of the previous model of approaching mixed trade agreements was Facultative Mixity as formulated by ECJ judge Alan Rossas, but after this judgement, it is pretty much no longer applicable, at least not in its traditional forms. Also how the judgement pertains to Investor-State dispute settlements is a complete game changer. The issue on who holds what competency was in question hence why it went to the CJEU for clarification. 3)	This links to the second bullet point, but to address your point, the judgement at its most simple basically said the EU has exclusive competence in all areas, but those that cover protection measures in non-direct foreign investment and investor-state dispute settlement. The judgement takes a much wider approach in highlighting areas of EU exclusive competence than was earlier suggested by AG Sharpston only back in December 2016 (this was non-binding though) https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2016-12/cp160147en.pdf where they considered more areas of air transport, maritime transport, state procurement and a few other areas as shared competencies, the recent judgement does not find these areas to be shared competencies. This decision was considered the status quo and represents a shift. 4)	I donâ€™t say anything about concluding a FTA before Article 50 is complete, and I am not suggesting there will not be a provisional agreement.  I am saying the UK could approach any agreement whether it is provisional or the final trade agreement with the EU (need not be Free trade) by dividing it into multiple agreements that divide along the lines of competencies which could potentially make negotiations easier. I appreciate the time and effort you have spent to respond to the article, and it definitely will change how we publish our articles in future, but I donâ€™t appreciate the slander of the company, because I feel everything presented is factual and correct, just maybe poorly written.

Though I have built up a list of sources that can help me look more knowledgable than I actually am. The area I've looked in to in more detail than any other and continue to keep a close watch on is the state of hmrc's IT and their ability adapt systems in time. The consequences of failure here are more significant than anything else when it comes to the day one disaster scenarios. And will for various reasons take longer to resolve than most would assume.

Partly because it provides an opportunity to enjoy a cathartic morning vent (though I'll be a little more wary in future, if that was a trap you laid then very well done). But mostly because of a desire to get an after work programming project going (it's so hard to build momentum on such a thing), given the scale of the changes there must be some profitable niches to hook in to that no one else has considered.

It's not a 'done deal' as I had thought but neither is it a failed agreement as you have said.

19450,6,fractalvoid,"You are right failed agreement is not the right choice of words, and it potentially still is en route to ratification. Personally and professionally though I think CETA is most likely still a long way off and will be amended, or less likely will be scrapped; I am sceptical that its current incarnation will be pushed through again for a number of reasons. Firstly there is a framework in the treaty itself that allows the EU and Canada to adopt the workings of CETA prior to member state ratification, neither party has begun this or timetabled it, and its one of those systems where you have to give significant notice before it comes into effect. If they went with this option the public outrage from this after rejection will feed already growing anti-EU sentiment, something the EU is not so keen on especially after Brexit.  Secondly CETA is taking a very interesting political dimension both in Canada and in Europe. At the moment Canada is focused on protecting its role in NAFTA, something Donald Trump wants to renegotiate or scrap, he has said he will keep it for now, but iirc he has called it the worst deal ever in American history. Also CETA has become a bit of a pinata for anti-globalists in Europe, Macron pledged to look into it, although I think that was more of his attempt to appeal to non-globalists rather than being opposed to it. Also some countries like Slovakia and Bulgaria have already stated they will not ratify it, I can't remember the explicit reasoning, but something to do with asymmetry in visa requirements for their citizens to Canda and Canadian to EU states. Visegrad group have also locked horns with the EU and I am sure they will use this to kick the EU down. I also know one person who worked on CETA on the EU institutional level and they are no longer working on it, suggesting, for now, they will leave it in stasis.

19452,6,tweeglitch,"member state agreement needs to be part of the process and not an all or nothing sign off at the end. This is like the old waterfall model of software development which is too inflexible when it comes to meeting changing requirements during development. Instead something like a prototyping approach might be more successful. Negotiators can come up with a rough sketch first then states can say yay, nay, or yay but on what there is so far. Initially aim for a minimal viable product smallest/sketchiest thing that WTO will allow as a trade deal. That then makes it easier to get member state agreement as there is less there to object to because there is simply less there. Once an actual product (or in this case agreement) is out in the wild being used by real users (or states and traders in this case) then there is real world feedback on what you have so far upon which you can base decisions on what you want to bolt on to the agreement next. It may be that trade negotiators have something useful to learn from modern agile software development processes. I may be agreeing with something youâ€™ve already said in your three other points but I havenâ€™t properly picked through them yet because it was sunnyâ€¦ and I wanted to go for a bike ride.How and by who are the initial requirements for a deal drawn up or do negotiators simply sit down and get to work starting with a blank sheet?Also how relevant are comprehensive trade deals between states/blocs nowadays because the point of the WTOâ€™s MFN rule is to reduce tariffs right? But thanks to its success arenâ€™t tariffs now much less of a problem as opposed to NTBs? And so adoption of global standards within particular trade sectors and mutual recognition agreements on the adoption of those standards between states are more relevant?

19454,6,fractalvoid,"It's not necessarily an all or nothing sign off at the end, a rejection or constitutional incompatibility can allow for revision of the specific part of the treaty that is causing a problem, and this is pretty much the norm most famously the Lisbon Treaty (not a trade agreement, but the back and forth and rejections were infamous), but I think CETA currently suffers from a lack of political will on either part the EU or Canada to push through currently. TTIP got torn to shreds by Trump, and Canada's ace in the hole as a sort of free market bridge between USA and EU is at threat with NAFTA and economic protectionists are winning popular support all over Europe, the appetite just isn't quite there just now. rI get your point of treaty building blocks and to some extent, these do exist if we look at International Relations top down rather than by separate agreements ie treaty a replaces treaty b and expands on x and y. Although in general trade agreements are meant to be definitive and final, because they define the relationship between the states and are meant to serve as a platform for economic integration, opportunity and cooperation, and business doesn't perform well and is hesitant to commit unless all the major hurdles are put down. Also for each revision of a trade agreement, even if it is one sentence you are likely to require to go through the whole process of ratification again, you are better off bundling everything in and troubleshooting all the problems en masse, rather than one at a time. It's different for each trade deal, but a mixture of lobbying, shared goals and economic needs start trade negotiations and much discussion between the two sides happens before any pen touches paper on the actual content of the agreement. Trade deals between states are extremely important, they shape political, social and economic landscapes and as such tend to be extremely comprehensive.  They don't just contain provisions on tariffs but agree on processes, jurisdiction, levels of economic integration, what role the state has in business and define business law and conduct, rights of citizens and companies and much more. The WTO is a significantly different creature from the EU and they take different views on free trade and what constitutes a violation or barrier to it. Every WTO signatory still has a plethora of tariffs and employs non-trade barriers, it is weaker institutionally and covers far less than EU institutions, it is not a customs union or a single market and lacks any political or legislative infrastructure and thus unlikely to adopt global standards unless everyone wills it (there are a few however), what is more likely than seeing global standards and already happening is WTO members forming their own regional customs and market blocs. Mutual Recognition Agreements on  a state by state sector by sector basis will be largely complex outside of the developed World (not the same environmental, quality, product testing, quality assurance, safe to use materials, laws backing refund or consumer rights) I cant see that being a viable way forward for the UK in economic opportunity.

Defence spending seems to have been diminishing whether labour or Tory were in power, this century to date (http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/past_spending) and May's hard brexit will do more damage to GDP than the other party's approaches (so, less money for everything, including defence).  Corbyn promised recently if the military were deployed, they'd be deployed with proper equipment.  lots of people have made the link between wars and UK focused terrorism (Boris Johnson, the Joint intelligence committee (2003), and May seems to be admitting that recent wars have not been successful, in 2016: ""This cannot mean a return to the failed policies of the past. The days of Britain and America intervening in sovereign countries in an attempt to remake the world in our own image are over."")

19488,6,StrixTechnica,"You don't *have* to, but I think it was perfectly reasonable to in the circumstances.  The EC had already drawn some very stern lines by that point, so yeah, I'm going to say that the EC set the tone for May's letter including the equally-stern starting point that nothing, not even security relations, should be taken for granted.That depends on the objectives of the negotiating parties.  This is different from FTA negotiations wherein no prior relationship exists and both parties want something better than the *status quo*.The starting positions could have been considerably more conciliatory on both sides than actually turned out to be the case but, given that the EC's negotiation policy and intent was perfectly clear long before March 29 and Tusk's subsequent official draft negotiation, May's hard-line stance was inevitable given hostilities that have been dribbling out of Brussels ever since June last year.The UK has no (valid) reason to chill security and intelligence relations (assuming good faith on the part of May and her Cabinet, since I know of no hard evidence to do otherwise at this point), in view of said hostile sentiment from Brussels and in view of the EC's ideologically-driven approach to European politics, it is my *assumption* that failure to negotiate will, more likely than not, be the fault of the EC rather than the UK.However, in my last response to you, I was careful to word things as neutrally as possible to indicate that in no way do I put it past May *et al.* to screw up and be responsible for the outcome.  That absolutely is possible, but I think less likely than more for the following reasons:The UK wants something from the EU and should therefore be well-motivated to get the best possible outcome without crossing its own red-lines (namely exit from the EU and abolition of all subordinate relationships with any foreign power or entity, as distinct from commitments made by agreement as between equals).In contrast, the EU wants to protect its political project more than it wants anything from the UK, even our financial contributions as second largest net.  For the EU, the sanctity of the Four Freedoms, the â‚¬ and the principle of ""ever closer union"" which, of economic and philosophical necessity, inevitably must end in full political union â€” all of which are purely ideological in origin â€” together with the political risk of the disintegration of other states from either the â‚¬Z or the EU, seem to weigh on them far greater than any interest in what the UK might have to offer.The UK's objectives are trade and economic, where the EU's objectives are predominantly if not nearly exclusively political.  It is a stark contrast, indeed.Do you dispute my characterisation of the motivators of both parties?  If so, why?  If not, then why is it not reasonable to assume (until evidence to the contrary becomes apparent) that the UK is likely to be far more pragmatic in its approach to the EC than the other way around?I disagree, because the EC **has** to know, up front, that a hard and disorderly Brexit absolutely is on the table.  They have to know that we have our red-lines just as they have theirs, that both parties have a joint responsibility to avoid a disorderly departure and that they cannot assume that May won't call their bluff and just walk.Well, Thatcher still has many admirers.  I'm not one of them, even if I think she did some good things.  I think Labour has done good things, too; I'm not partisan in that way, which is why I vote tactically.  Amongst Thatcher's worst decisions were to sell off social housing stock, and selling off nationalised assets was a mistake in some cases, though not nearly as catastrophic as relying on private landlords to the extent that we now do.At this moment, in these circumstances, it is my view that we could do much worse than Thatcher 2.0.  It was only because of Thatcher that we avoided the economic catastrophe that is the â‚¬.  Had we joined the â‚¬Z as we were expected to (and as some Labour, LD and probably some Tory politicians wanted), we'd be absolutely shafted economically because the floating Â£ and our ability to control our own money supply are the only things that protect our ability to retain a functional economy and enact the fiscal policy of the government of the day â€” which doubtless will one day include Labour, though not under Corbyn.",di6y1r2,di6ulpe,6dq2ct,2.90E-08,-0.999999942,Against,29-05-17

We do so under the WTO rules *as mutually agreed upon*.  The UK entered into a treaty that became something very, very different from the one which we agreed to.

The EC is free to impose whatever it likes on member states and, short of exercising its veto, not even the EP has the power to do anything about what the EC decides to do.  Yeah, but nor does the referee have his or her own agenda, where the EC clearly does, and the ECJ interprets and enforces the will of the EC.  Also, there is no on-going obligation between teams to continue to play each other.  Organisations like the FA exist, but no club is ever obliged to field a team every year.Sure, and yet world trade extends far beyond the EEA and therefore the jurisdiction of the ECJ.  In fact, less than half of our exports go to the EU now anyway so the ECJ is *relatively* insignificant to us economically (and, soon, politically).Everything you've written presupposes that the EU and ECJ is the last word in international relations.

I didn't say anything about how those rules should come in to being whether through democratic consent as per the EU or imposed without. I just said rules were needed. A treaty is composed of rules not random text.If there are rules then there needs to arbitration when there is disagreement on their application and judgements will need to be made as to whether or not they have been broken in any particular case and penalties applied if so.If there is cooperation between territories then no one party to that cooperation can possibly be an unbiased judge on those rules so some extraterritorial authority is required to take that role.

If France don't vote for a US war, the US buys 15% less French products. So what happens to our EU based consumer's attitudes when we turn our back on the EU?

19502,6,tweeglitch,"Slowly but surely? Depending on what has been negotiated then perhaps yes but if there is no negotiated arrangement for trade (or a bad one) then a sudden and catastrophic stop.The imposition of EU 3rd country customs and other border checks on UK exports coupled with the very likely failure of UK customs systems (there is no time to adapt them to the new trading environment) will bring a Brexit day one halt to trade. Exports from other non-EU partners have grown around these barriers and cleared some of the initial hurdles as trade with the EU by country or business is not always automatic (particularly food and livestock). Sans a negotiated settlement i.e. Mayâ€™s walk away â€˜optionâ€™, the EU would be legally obliged by WTO MFN rules to impose the same checks on UK exports as per any other third country. And that would seem fair. However such an abrupt and profound change in the conditions of trade would in practice act as a blockade. And the EU are already preparing for this scenario; for example the commission has been instructed to â€œstart considering the practical aspects of disconnecting access from non-public databases hosted by EU bodiesâ€. Information systems such as those related to safety and security wrt imports and exports for example. This automatically would put the UK in the highest risk category re goods and so making exported UK goods subject to the highest level of scrutiny.[As a taster lets look at the food safety checks that must be cleared before EU entry](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0429&amp;qid=1486817283161&amp;from=EN). Briefly:1. The ability to export to the EU is not automatic. Firstly, the UK will have to formally apply to the European Commission to be designated as an ""approved country"" in order to be listed on the relevant databases. Or rather re-listed.2. Then each individual business wishing to export has to be inspected and certified as an ""approved establishment"". These procedures alone could take months to complete or at least months in normal circumstances but only then are the businesses allocated an official ""establishment number"" which must be marked on all goods exported to the EU.3. all products, including live animals, must be certified as compliant with the EU's animal health requirements and all other relevant regulation. This goes beyond merely being produced in approved establishments. The operational procedures under which goods are produced (or animals kept) must conform with current EU rules.4. goods must then be accompanied by certificates and other relevant documentation required by EU export regulations. This can mean having to obtain veterinary certificates from ""official veterinarians"", or certificates of conformity from the relevant enforcement officials.5. such goods may only enter into EU circulation via a ""Border Inspection Post"" where they are subject to a series of checks. These may be as straightforward as simple documentation check ensuring all relevant certificates are provided. But can include load verification â€“ physical checks of vehicle/container to ascertain whether contents match document descriptions. Checks can also extend to opening packaging to verify contents conform to labelling and goods may be physically inspected to ensure they comply with quality and marketing regulations. Samples may also be taken which can be sent for testing for such things as presence of microbiological contamination or pesticide residues. The time taken may vary from a few hours or where samples are taken several days. But only when they have passed checks and been certified as suitable for free circulation can they finally be presented to customs for admission to the EU. Yes that's right we haven't even got to customs valuation and rules of origin checks.Presently such goods are rolling in to France etc from where ever in the UK as they would between any two points within the UK.",di7s0ou,6e3u1y,6e3u1y,4.43E-08,-0.999999911,Against,30-05-17

Brexit has been barely mentioned in this campaign but it'll be the only story for months afterwards.Entirely disengaging with the EU, including the Single Market and Customs Union, is simply no longer possible for Britain.

Because Tories haven't been real at any stage (since pre-referendum) they have had to keep on with the bluster and blaming, because they are obliged to keep up the manipulations and lies (may was at it again today - bland idiocies on brexit, versus Corbyn today making it honestly clear, no deal is disaster), and because they've adopted such an approach, and sustained the bad deal line (voting Tory gives them that mandate) the worst case WTO rules exit is much more likely if Tories are negotiating.

Corbyn's exit will be gentler, and if the population does become aware of the consequences, then a large tory majority will steam roll on into ideologically motivated disaster (their inclusion of no deal comments in their manifesto logically makes them unelectable); whereas a no majority parliament, or a small minority one, would be much more likely to behave democratically.   Its also just a good time for honest, calm leadership rather than angry, desperate manipulative leadership; and if labour can help those in need, then one of the drivers (desperation) for leaving the EU disappears.

19605,6,amgiecorker,"I agree; it is depressing that we decided to leave. The reason we voted to leave is because not enough people knew facts (that's true - for example, at least 40% thought brexit wouldn't hurt the economy - so if you're desperate and you know that, then you vote to stay: if you're desperate and you don't know that, you vote to leave); partly that's down to strong media manipulation in order for media owners - and the Tories - to get their way.  (to be clear, some minority of leavers have valid ideological reasons for wanting to leave; but there's no way the majority would have voted to leave if they knew the impacts) That is bad.  Business owners and politicians combing to manipulate the population. Its also part of life I guess, but it has got way way out of hand (evidenced by Trump and Brexit).   I think the pendulum will swing back (extremes don't last) and it can be combated, over time, by sharing facts and alternate perspectives.  I regard leaving EU as crazy; lots of definite negative impacts; massive exposure to risk; no benefits.   But we're *not* obliged to leave in anyway at all - EU have said, just tell us and we'll happily stop the leaving process, no red tape, it just stops; and apparently they continue to be helpful, the Indy just reported that EU said they'll postpone negotiations if Corbyn needs time to prepare. but but..the will of the people?  The will of the people changes a lot - we vote every five years (will be at least three years between referendum and exit); court cases get appealed if new evidence is found; if we're going to claim we're being democratic, then there must be provision to capture any change in public opinion.  If the status quo remains true (Tory undemocratic steam roller to brexit) we have long term damage to society, culture, public sector, the environment, very likely workers rights and certainly the economy. However, if certain things happen now (more honest politicians in power, ideally a mix of parties, in charge; more clear evidence of of the damage being done making enough of the population go wtf?, etc) then the chances of at least negotiating a more intelligent exit than the Tory one, or getting another vote on exit at appropriate time, increase dramatically. So sharing evidence of bad news now, is likely to have positive impact medium/long term.

When of course there is, it just doesn't suit anyone to say so yet.Brexit can be stopped, so thinking it's a done deal right now is premature. And it could be suspended sooner than you might think. Theresa May has called an election to secure a mandate for her Brexit negotiating position. If she turns up in Brussels on 19 June with a massively-reduced majority of 5, perhaps bolstered by the DUP, can she really say she has that mandate? Or if Labour come within striking distance of them and manage to put together a coalition of just them and the SNP? The EU has already said they'd postpone the talks to assist a new UK administration. Plus in a scenario where the Tories, having gone to the people for a Brexit mandate actually end up out of government, wouldn't that call into question the entire Brexit result?

""Ok, the UK have voted to leave.  This is going to be complicated, we don't yet understand all the implications, and its going to take years.  We'll try to get the best possible deal, and in a few years, run it past you all again to make sure we're headed down the right path"")The above is the democratic, intelligent, and responsible approach; Tories are just steam rolling us. (they used democracy as an excuse (""the will of the people"") but they had to be taken to court before they would actually do anything democratic in this area - actions are louder than words; and this election (from ""I'm not going to call an election"", ""I'm not going to call an election"", ""whoops I called an election"" May) is timed to avoid any further democracy in brexit)So they're really not much bothered about the people of the UK, and if they get a large majority on the 8th, then that's the end of democracy around brexit for five years (read on if you don't yet know why that's a very very bad thing)Witness Theresa May at that question time event on Friday; she has no effective help to offer on the lack of mental health care; none to offer for the public sector workers who've had a 14% pay cut (effectively) since (Tory) austerity began; etc. And the Tories put the NHS into it's current state (one of the lowest funded in Europe) so its silly to think they're going to rescue it.  So if we're worried about public services and infrastructure and such, we need to be looking at others - maybe labour have the most advanced plans in these area, but the greens and lib dems (and others) are also committed to more humane government. So should we vote May just to get a competent brexit? Really really not, no.  May's no deal, better than bad deal, is economically insane and would wreak havoc, and it is possible to believe the Tories would actually do it (because, if we vote for them, we give them a mandate to do it - it is in their manifesto: they would be doing the ""will of the people again"", and they will grab this chance now to force their ideology onto us, - I think at any cost - because they know they won't get this chance again for a generation (that's why they are avoiding any further democratic involvement))Its also not a good negotiating strategy; all of the 27 know that the UK suffers many magnitudes higher than the EU if there is no deal.  so it's just platitudes, more soundbites, manipulation.  Its the only plan the Tories have apparently (they claim to have one, but won't tell us, as its secret and we shouldn't be worrying our pretty heads about it), designed to create this feeling of conflict (UK vs EU) so that we get scared and vote for May (she is in such a weak position, she must generate enemies to get us on board - humans use stories to understand complexity, she needs us to believe there is an enemy)Many experienced negotiators say we should approach it collaboratively, develop good relationships with the EU, convince, persuade, agree, for the good of all 28 members.  We'd need a more human government than the Tories to make a success of brexit. and May's weakness on criticising Trumps avoidance of action on climate change is just a sign of things to come; a large part of brexit is about the Tories reducing regulations on businesses, on who we trade with, etc -  So arms to dictators, will be fine (for example of dodgyness, they want a deal with Saudi, whom the EU wouldn't deal with due to all the human rights violations). and waving climate protections is also fine if it gets us Trade deals (we're about to damage 44% of our export market and we become a very small global player in trade - (compared to the EU) so we will be desperate for any trade deals with anyone. So should we vote May to avoid Corbyn? May appears robotic and false with people, and is manipulating and tricking us. TV appearances have shown Corbyn is a decent bloke, apparently compulsively honest with the public, with some manifesto promises that have been judged as good, well costed for a manifesto (the Tories have frequently been accused of not costing their manifesto - it doesn't matter to them - they are just really really excited that their brexit baby is coming soon). So overall, IMO, ""Not the Tories"" is the only thing that matters in this election.  Google tactical voting if you want to find ways to stop them in your constituency.

These benefits are the sort of stuff the Tories have been manipulating us into losing. ""The UKâ€™s net contribution to the EU budget is around â‚¬7.3bn, or 0.4% of GDP. As a comparison thatâ€™s around a quarter of what the UK spends on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and less than an eighth of the UKâ€™s defence spend.  The Â£116 per person net contribution is less than that from Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands."" (from http://www.cbi.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/our-global-future/factsheets/factsheet-2-benefits-of-eu-membership-outweigh-costs/)One of the aims of the EU is peace in Europe (""""to make war not only unthinkable but materially impossible""., Robert Schuman) with a parallel focus on International SecurityThe EU got the Nobel Peace prize in 2010, so it seems to have worked.  Remember, when the EU was conceived, Europe had just been through two world wars, both focused on Europe. There's a lot of evidence that membership of the EU single market seems to increase the GDP of the members. (i.e. http://econ.economicshelp.org/2007/03/benefits-of-european-union.html, point number 4)Obviously that has knock on effects (a well performing economy has more jobs, etc) and the UK relies on the Single Market a lot (""44.6 per cent of all UK exports of goods and services, and 53.2 per cent of the UKâ€™s imports of goods and services."" )  and ""the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) shows the overall contribution to our economy from exports to the EU was Â£187 billion last year, and that it could rise by almost half again to Â£277 billion a year by 2030.""No customs barriers makes trade cheaper and quicker (and hence, products cheaper for consumers)""76% of CBI members say that the ability to freely buy and sell products in the EU has had a positive impact on their business, including 74% of SMEs.""""It has been estimated that UK trade with some countries in Europe could have increased by as much as 50% as a result of EU membership.""http://www.cbi.org.uk/insight-and-analysis/our-global-future/factsheets/factsheet-2-benefits-of-eu-membership-outweigh-costs/and as pointed out above, the single market is an enabler for many supply chains (auto mobile industry being the oft quoted example)and being an EU member, especially an influential one, gives us much greater influence on the world stage (including the bridge into Europe status, which help explain our special relationship with the US for example) â€œFor a mid-sized country like the UK, which will never again be economically dominant either globally or regionally, and whose diplomatic and military resources are declining in relative terms, being a major player in a strong regional institution can offer a critical lever for international influence (Robin Niblett, Director of think-tank Chatham House)Poorer areas (even in richer countries) get transformation funding to help improve outcomes (Wales, Cornwall, Scotland and Northern areas have benefited from this. In particular, this funding creates jobs in areas where they are most needed. If that help goes to other countries, it helps raise EU GDP performance, creating more EU jobs, more consumers for UK products (and hence more UK jobs)Being part of the EU helps attract foreign investment into the UK (""The UK is the 5th largest source of inward investment in the world, and being a member of the single market is an important factor in encouraging Japanese firms."") and (As the EUâ€™s leading investment destination, the UK was a key beneficiary: the EU accounted for 47% of the UKâ€™s stock of inward FDI at the end of 2011, with investments worth over $1.2 trillion.) (from the CBI url quoted above)Free movement of people is economically, very good for the economy.  (recent estimates suggest stopping it will cost The EU enables collaboration on security issues and information ""Last month, former director of public prosecutions Sir Keir Starmer told The Independent: â€œWe rely very heavily on the EU criminal justice measures and when I say very heavily, I mean 24/7. Iâ€™m talking here about terrorism, people trafficking, cyber-crime, sexual exploitation, trafficking of children and paedophilia: they all go across the borders into Europe.â€EU wide programmes give a variety of opportunities to citizens in each EU country (obviously, including the UK). i.e. The Eramus programme (education, training including life long learning, youth and sport) is a good example, allowing UK students to go and study (with associated accommodation arrangements) in European countries (""For many European students, the Erasmus Programme is their first time living and studying in another country. Hence, it has become a cultural phenomenon and is very popular among European students"")the EU also legislates to ensure Equal opportunities (and provides an escalation mechanism when opportunities are not equal), sets standards of democracy and human rights for member countries, freedom of travel to anywhere in the EU, consumer protections/shopping rights. it enables us to retire to anywhere in Europe, if we so wish, but still get our UK pension (how good is that?  its why many live in Spain - UK money went much further there apparently).

(they suspect that they won't be able to fool us twice)Whilst reading this list, bear in mind the amount we pay for this is tiny (0.4 % of GDP). the list of benefits is just illustrative, not exhaustive.""The UKâ€™s net contribution to the EU budget is around â‚¬7.3bn, or 0.4% of GDP. As a comparison thatâ€™s around a quarter of what the UK spends on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and less than an eighth of the UKâ€™s defence spend.

In particular, this funding creates jobs in areas where they are most needed.If that help goes to other countries, it helps raise EU GDP performance, creating more EU jobs, more consumers for UK products (and hence more UK jobs)Being part of the EU helps attract foreign investment into the UK (""The UK is the 5th largest source of inward investment in the world, and being a member of the single market is an important factor in encouraging Japanese firms."") and (As the EUâ€™s leading investment destination, the UK was a key beneficiary: the EU accounted for 47% of the UKâ€™s stock of inward FDI at the end of 2011, with investments worth over $1.2 trillion.)

19786,6,tweeglitch,"Those computers have software running on them. Software is made of rules. With Brexit the rules will change. And so software will need to be updated.HMRCâ€™s customs systems are an essential cog in the machine integrated with community systems providers scheduling and coordinating the flow of goods in and out of the UK through every one of its ports and airports. Pause and ponderâ€¦ flow of goodsâ€¦ every port. What could possibly go wrong! In addition it interfaces with EU wide security and safety systems: the import and export control systems (ics and ecs) and the other one for fags booze and petrol (emcs). â€˜Eu wideâ€™ ermâ€¦ oops! And it might even continue working well enough to collect revenue who knows!The UKâ€™s customs systems cannot be updated in time because there will be no time; itâ€™s not until negotiations are complete that there can be surety and clarity on what the new rules will be. And upon those rules technical specifications can be drawn up for developers to follow. If those negotiations take zero seconds then there is the entire two year article 50 period to make adjustments. If however they take up that entire two years then there is a remaining zero seconds. I would tend toward the latter. An ambitious timeframe for a government IT project wouldn't you think?As well as the lack or perhaps complete absence of time to do this work a further difficulty is that Revenue and Customs are part way through a re-write (alarm bells already) from the existing CHIEF system to CDS so as to implement the planned to be EU wide UCC processes (though not sure how relevant many of them will be post brexit). Re-writes are a huge risk as the existing system has been tested in the field by millions of users over decades. The new system obviously hasn't. This total overhaul however is due for release a month before the UK's currently projected EU exit date just to throw some more chaos in to the mix. And of course leaving the EU wasnâ€™t anticipated when work began on this (oh boy).It will also need to scale for the huge increase in declarations to be put through the system from traders previously used to the ease and simplicity of doing business within the EU whoâ€™ll be cluelessly pushing all the wrong buttons and clogging up tech support.However CDS wonâ€™t be ready in time; government IT projects tend to overrun by years and overspend by billions (NHS Connecting for Health Â£2.3bn originally estimated, after ten years Â£22bn eventually spent while the system is mostly abandoned, Universal Credit Â£2.2bn originally estimated Â£12.8bn so far spent and not sure if abandoned or still in progress) and this isnâ€™t the first attempt to rewrite CHIEF either. So given the near certainty that CDS wonâ€™t be ready this means the existing CHIEF system will still be in use come Brexit time. So it too will need to be scaled and updated to take account of the near upending of the UKâ€™s trading arrangements with every other country  on Earth.CHIEF was not written yesterday by teenagers in javascript using node js. It was written in the 80s using COBOL, ICL OS and DBMS (ICL went out of business 15 years ago). Updating this system will be particularly challenging given the reason for the rewrite as opposed to adapting it (the reason for most rewrites) is that CHIEF as HMRC have admitted has become too risky expensive and time consuming to make changes to. This tends to happen as modifications are made to millions of lines of code by a stream of programmers over a quarter of a centuryâ€¦ things tend to get a little bent out of shape.Iâ€™d liken situation to an army on the move (from CHIEF to CDS) about to be ambushed (as thereâ€™s no time to prepare) by an overwhelming force as the environment in which this system was written to operate will be radically altered, everything it currently does, every function point will be under attack from some need for change.And thereâ€™ll be no going back either because when it all goes wrong the build canâ€™t be pulled and the previous version installed because the previous version is the EU model. And what makes this project even more failure prone (if it didnâ€™t have enough stacked against it) is that two years post article 50 notification itâ€™s pencils down whether youâ€™ve finished or not. With other large IT projects you sometimes have the option to carry on until you run out of money or the system under development becomes obsolete (e.g. the BBCâ€™s abandoned before completion digital media initiative superseded by youtube, just under a billion wasted on that). Hard Brexit though brings with it a hard deadline.The absence of any functioning customs system together with EU 3rd country customs formalities being imposed on the other side of the channel will gridlock ports. For example all agri-goods must pass through suitably equipped and staffed border inspection posts before EU entry and the nearest usable for UK trade is at Dunkirk. Will the French upgrade this facility to take account of the increase in traffic that will have to pass through it so as to allow UK farmers to continue competing with their own due to a problems of the Brits own making? There will be mountains of cows piling up at Dover port and â€˜operation stackâ€™ will become the norm with trucks lining the entire M20 and backed up the M25. This isnâ€™t fixable. Trade will be choked off to a volume and rate as can be handled by a paper system first.Which is all a bit of a problem for a country 60% dependant on imports for its food especially considering those imports will become increasingly expensive with the drop in sterling and especially considering the UKâ€™s food system is highly dependant on migrant labour and especially considering subsidies 55% of the average farm income are unlikely to be continued.The problems are too vast to be addressed in the time available and so hence the reason they arenâ€™t being addressed. There is nothing for example happing to replace the various EU regulatory bodies in medicine, air safety, the chemicals industry and the nuclear industry. Businesses supply chains can't adapt in time and due to the 'just in time' nature of modern logistics (though very efficient under normal circumstances) are highly vulnerable to disruption particularly when sustained over a week e.g. the threat to the food system posed by truckers fuel protest in the UK year 2000.So yeah. Empty supermarket shelves.On the other hand though faced with this the UK may fling open its borders and then party time for the drugs arms and people smugglers which hardly chimes with â€œtaking back control of our bordersâ€ and it will gut UK industry and farming but I suppose it might be better than food rationing.",dihhe2a,digj3sb,6f5q5v,0.576319738,0.152639477,Neutral,05-06-17

Will both be scaled in time for the increase in throughput - CHIEF is already on the brink of not being able to cope with existing traffic suffering frequent downtime. What is this hope based on? Has work begun on increasing BIP facilities at Dunkirk? Is this the kind of of customs arrangements the EU are hoping to sort out: Italianier, Slemayr and Barnier have signed and sent a memo to commission instructing that services and agencies should â€œstart considering the practical aspects of disconnecting access from non-public databases hosted by EU bodiesâ€. Information systems such as those related to safety and security of imports and exports for example. This automatically would put the UK in the highest risk category re goods and so making exported UK goods subject to the highest level of scrutiny.Old languages still work. Old code increasingly doesn't as more mods are made to keep it up to date with new rules and legislation. Old code naturally is written in old languages and there are fewer people available to fix the stuff written in it. And that doesn't just apply to customs systems, a whole raft of others in government, business, logistics and finance systems.Dunkirk is the nearest port to the UK with a BIP which is why I mention it i.e. in the context of the food safety checks that UK goods entering the EU will be subject to spwcifically REGULATION (EU) 2016/429, read it and weep: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0429&amp;qid=1486817283161&amp;from=ENbut here are the headlines:Firstly the ability to export to the EU is not automatic. The UK will have to formally apply to the European Commission to be designated as an ""approved country"" in order to be listed on the relevant databases. Or rather re-listed (see point above).Then each individual business wishing to export has to be inspected and certified as an ""approved establishment"". These procedures alone could take months to complete or at least months in normal circumstances but only then are the businesses allocated an official ""establishment number"" which must be marked on all goods exported to the EU.All products, including live animals, must be certified as compliant with the EU's animal health requirements and all other relevant regulation. This goes beyond merely being produced in approved establishments. The operational procedures under which goods are produced (or animals kept) must conform with current EU rules.Goods must then be accompanied by certificates and other relevant documentation required by EU export regulations. This can mean having to obtain veterinary certificates from ""official veterinarians"", or certificates of conformity from the relevant enforcement officials.Such goods may ten only enter into EU circulation via a ""Border Inspection Post"" where they are subject to a series of checks. These may be as straightforward as simple documentation check ensuring all relevant certificates are provided. But can include load verification â€“ physical checks of vehicle/container content to ascertain whether they match descriptions on documents. Checks can also extend to opening packaging to verify contents conform to labelling and goods may be physically inspected to ensure they comply with quality and marketing regulations. Samples may also be taken which can be sent for testing such things as presence of microbiological contamination or pesticide residues. The time taken may vary from a few hours or where samples are taken several days. But only when they have passed checks and been certified as suitable for free circulation can they finally be presented to customs for admission to the EU. Yes that's right we haven't even got to customs and valuation and rules of origin checks.Given that currently it's as easy for a UK business to sell food to anywhere else in the EU as it is to anywhere in the UK that's quite a significant change yeh? For all practical purposes that's the end of the UK's food and livestock exports to the EU.As I said earlier on the Border Inspection Post requirement the nearest to UK for its trade with EU is at Dunkirk. Do you think the French will be happy to spend the millions so as to upgrade this facility to allow for the quintupling of traffic that would need to pass through it for the UK were to maintain it's current level of trade with rest of EU? Do you think they even have time to do this? Do you think the French farmers will be happy to allow the French Govt to spend their tax money so as to allow UK farmers to continue to compete with them? To help the UK out of a problem of its own making?Maybe I wasn't clear but you completely misunderstood my point; faced with the impossible challenge of having anything like a functioning customs system ready on time for Brexit the UK may not bother with one i.e. given the choice between food shortages and flinging the doors open to allow anything and everything through so as to allow trade flows they may opt for the latter.",dihkadp,dihiiq4,6f5q5v,0.004132216,-0.991735569,Against,05-06-17

Make sure you have enough money / income to survive the uncertain period so your investments can mature over the years. As I said above, the trends currently are to move assets out of this country. Are you strong and knowledgeable enough to go against the market trends? Do you have enough cash to invest and wait until it becomes profitable?

My main objection to the EU is that it is fundamentally an attempt to create a government for Europe, which can fairly easily be traced back to Monnet, Schuman, etc. Now obviously there's a lot of nuance there but in the interest of brevity, that is my most basic reason.However, that obviously doesn't address practical questions of how we leave the EU without causing economic damage. It is here I support Booker and North's idea to preferably move initially to a 'Norway' position (ie rejoin EFTA to remain in the EEA), as it goes a long way to securing our trade position, before then moving on from there (which is a whole different debate).I'll also add that you create a straw man by saying:'Can you explain why you think this country and the whole Europe are better divided, not together?'I don't think that, nor does Brexit have to lead to that.

19849,6,mynewsfilter,"Thanks, I appreciate that. That does make sense what you said, however... It will be very difficult (but not impossible) to achieve the 'Norway' position. Maybe that's the way forward. Problem I see here is that the major points of brexit will not be achieved (e.g. to cut the immigration as Norway supports free movement on that agreement) not to mention other statements advertised by the whole leave campaign - such as Â£350 million for NHS instead of sending it to the UK... That was a complete nonsense and a disgrace to all of us. Campaign based on lies...But let's move on... 1. One of the main reasons of bringing European Union to life was the fact that Europe was being left behind other countries. Both economically and technologically.2. Do you think UK can achieve more being out? Let's assume EU and Eurozone gets stronger in a long run, UK losing influence and has to comply with their regulations anyway (not to mention they will still have to contribute financially to EU's vaults as Norway does)So what is the point if the major points of leave campaign are not achieved? Aren't you afraid you will be left behind? You are not Norway and you have a completely different economy models. Financial systems heavily rely on EU partnership and some (most if that's required and deal not achieved) of these can be moved to Europe in a couple of years, I reckon. Many businesses started due diligence process already - which means they will move at some point as this process is usually very complicated and it's stopping many organisations to move to other locations. Once it's completed, it's easier (what's more important it's  possible) to move reasonably quickly. How long do you think businesses will be waiting for some legit statements from the government and the EU? They will swallow the costs and move away.

19850,6,APB2710,"It is a lot more difficult now than it would have been, had the remain and leave campaigns not spent their time lying and discrediting it, and had Teresa May not quickly ruled it out (she may come to regret that). The free movement point on Norway is arguable, since the EEA Agreement (involving the EFTA states of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein at present, as well as all EU states) does involve more flexible safeguard measures for non-EU states. North argues it here (http://bit.ly/2sde8fE). Up to you whether you view it as credible, but it's worth noting the Guardian reported it early after the referendum (http://bit.ly/2aDwFpW).Moreover, I'd point out it is not a static agreement. With UK backing in EFTA, I'd argue it is possible to renegotiate the agreement in the near future, a sentiment shared by the EFTA Court President when I recently heard him in Edinburgh.I don't dispute the Vote Leave campaign was terrible.'Do you think UK can achieve more being out?'I think there are opportunities. But they'd stem from a UK which is able to exercise its soft power at an international level. Power in shaping regulations and standards made at a global level in Geneva and elsewhere. The role of global regulators is often missed; EU regulations do not exist in a vacuum, many come from different sources.'(not to mention they will still have to contribute financially to EU's vaults as Norway does)'Not actually true. Norway, as the other EFTA/EEA states do, contribute towards programs and agencies they are a part of, which is reasonable (cross-border cooperation costs money). And they pay grants to poorer EEA states, with Norway paying considerably more as a form of soft power (hence 'EEA Grants' are often called 'Norway Grants' since Norway pays over 90% of them).

19872,6,amgiecorker,"The things the Tories are carefully not telling you about what they're doing to the economy (Brexit means much more than just Brexit) My strong impression is that most of the population have no idea what the Tories are actually doing to our economy.  That included me, so I've done a tiny bit of poking around.  Here's the results. Apologies for saying this, but if a Tory majority doesn't scare you, you haven't understood what a Tory majority means.  Long post; if time presses, reading just the quick summary will give you a feel for the risks. If a Tory majority *does* scare you then it is down to you to do something about it: share this, via whatever channel works, with people who don't yet know what a vote for May actually means.*****Quick summary: 90% of economists say we're on the cusp of a crap storm but leavers say it will be fine. Most of the leaver's evidence stems, directly or indirectly, from one group, promoted strongly by the Tory press (""Economists for Brexit"").  This group of economists have had to do extreme things in models of our economy to get a positive outcome from Brexit (removing workers rights, removing all tariffs, etc).  This extremism, which is necessary for brexit to appear to make any sense at all, indicates that the disastrous Tory WTO exit is much more likely than some think (the Tory's approach has already proven that they are on a different planet from most economists); also that the Tories are on the verge of changing your rights dramatically (*it is necessary for their economic and ideological goals*, which explains, why they haven't told us what they are up to); this is a gargantuan risk for our economy and society, but the model that Brexit is predicated on has severe methodology flaws, so that risk is even bigger than it first appears to be.Election soon, so the key takeaway here is: *Voting for may is a Massive risk*.  It is the most dangerous thing most of us will ever do.  It gives her a mandate to do whatever she likes, and the reason she hasn't told us what she's doing, is because she knows, we won't like it. Tory Brexit is much much bigger than simply leaving the EU.  (simply put:  rich richer, poor shafted, on a grand scale)*****Here's the main details. A lot of the leaver's optimism is based on one report by 'the economists for brexit"" but 90% of economists (figure from the guardian, but repeated in other sources) disagree with it (warning flag anyone?!) (i.e. ""analysis from the Bank of England to the OECD to academia has all concluded that Brexit would make us economically worse off.)  So how did the ""economists for brexit"" (the clue to bias, is in the name) achieve their remarkable figures? I've read a lot of criticism of the report; the comments below are draw from the following LSE post.http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-britain-alone-scenario-how-economists-for-brexit-defy-the-laws-of-gravity/The Economists for brexit study is based on the (*extreme*) idea that ""the UK should not bother striking new trade deals but instead unilaterally abolish all its import tariffs """"Minford admits his model predicts that the policy would cause the *â€˜eliminationâ€™ of UK manufacturing and a large increase in wage inequality.""*It is based on things like *dropping* ""labour market regulations such as the working time, agency workers, and gender equality directives"" What the hell?  These are extreme changes to the fabric of our country!!  Why aren't they in the headlines? How much have you heard May talking about reduced workers rights, dropping gender equality, and crazy extreme financial approach she's amenable too? (read on, but if you desire honesty in politicians note that you simply cannot elect this one - which of these she will adopt is unclear, but it is the extreme road that the Tories are ploughing, simply refusing to discuss or debate it, whilst straining every sinew to avoid democracy - they have warned us though; their manifesto says no deal better than a bad one, so *a vote for the Tories them gives them unrestrained freedom to claim the deal is bad, and then do whatever they like to the UK*) We already know that May's no deal exit would be economically disastrous (I'll random link some evidence below); but it seems fair to assume that people (i.e. the Tories) basing their whole theory on this one group of economists would have no problem going WTO (this model, that the Tory papers praised to the heavens for their readers, is even more extreme - so it is fair to assume (a conclusion supported by the Tories gnomic utterances) that the current gov don't find WTO as scary as they bloody well should).  Strong and Stable anyone?  I note May's stopped saying it, but it was just another lie. (wreaker of havoc, is more truthful, but then, she wouldn't have got many votes for saying that)LSE modelled this extreme idea and found ""there is a gain of only 0.3 percentage points from eliminating tariffs compared to just trading under WTO rules  and the British people are still considerably worse off as a result of Brexit."" [my note. remember WTO rules exit is widely regarded as a disaster and note this gain is compared to that disaster (so we'd lose like 6% or 8% of gdp through the Tory's WTO, or simply go into recession; this extreme plan would make us 0.3% better off from that low point) - i.e. this gain is not on top of our current highly favourable position in the free market]*Criticism of different parts of the report that leaver's hopes are primarily based on*, from the LSE article includes: ""This is really far-fetched. """"Minford misunderstands the nature of regulations and product standards""""safety standards would deteriorate""""Minford uses a 1970s style trade model"" which has been a failure before i.e. ""in 1997 the model predicted that the proposed national minimum wage would mean millions more unemployed""""If this sounds crazy, thatâ€™s because it is crazy.""And here's the final insult and an illustration of why the nation have bought into a crap storm of incoming pain (sold to us by the Tories); the way in which the Tory papers reported this (the report's authors names crops up again and again in these types of accounts).  I've used the Mail online here, but the Sun, Express and to some degree telegraph have all been accused of the same bias. ""Workers would be better off by Â£40 a week after Brexit, say economists: Group brand the euro an 'unmitigated disaster' and say membership holds back growth "" (april 2016)""UK economy is booming after brexit : project fear in tatters"" (sept 2016)""final nail into the project fear coffin"" (Sep 2016)""""Britain has the STRONGEST economy in the world despite Brexit warnings"" (Jan 2017)These are just a flavour of the manipulation going on.  i.e. a month or so back I read in the daily mail that Brexit will be a glowing success under our glorious mother Theresa, with a slight foot note, that of course, sometimes the economy could go down for other reasons, not related to brexit; that's simple straightforward manipulation ignoring reality - much like May's explanation of the sterling devaluation ""So there have been adjustments to sterling. It isn't just that sterling has gone down. Weâ€™ve seen currencies move around as currencies do"" May 2017).  As I've said elsewhere, I look forward to May explaining GDP crashing using the same language (GDP just moving around, as it does).  Meanwhile, back in the real world our economy has now crashed (in gdp) to the bottom of the G7 table (in 2016, we were near the top)A variety of indicators suggest we've got a lot of trouble ahead (see below; statistically, the 90% of economists are much more likely to be right, and evidence is mounting that they are ).  So...why did the Tory papers 'big up' this tiny minority of extreme economists?  To manipulate their readers into voting for and believing in brexit? ....despite the fact that the necessary measures would hurt their readers in order to benefit the rich? Yup, sounds about right, and is in character with all the stories that were reported to IPSO.  So here's a message for daily mail readers (I understand variants of it also applies to the sun, the express, the telegraph but I haven't double checked on those):  On brexit, and the general election your paper has been consistently trying to trick you into voting for things that the paper's editor wants.*if you are a daily mail reader, it is worth re-reading that last sentence and asking, does that seem ok to you?* And why am I talking about brexit now? Because the Tories called this election now, in order to give them such a big majority that they could simply steam roll these changes right through, ignoring democracy, ignoring parliament (as they have already proven they will do - remember they had to be taken to court to allow MPs any vote on article 50).  This is existential stuff happening here; the fabric and nature of the UK is about to change dramatically - this is way bigger than simply leaving the EU; this is much more than just 'Brexit'.  And the Tories are assuming that on 8th June you will give them a mandate to perform massive changes without actually telling you what they are doing.   Same question of that last sentence; does that seem ok to you?

I see no longer being a member of a attempt at European government as fundamentally a positive.However, in monetary terms, I don't disagree and your 80/20 ratio is entirely reasonable. The EU has effectively filled the vacuum following the UK Government's near complete detachment from reality (that grandposing you speak of), allowing them to set the agenda.Regrettably, there can't be a plan until the UK Government acknowledges they have to make compromises. You can play the amateur game theorist and say the UK's stance is hard because they intend to compromise in private and that's where the plan they allegedly have comes into play. However, leading brexiters like Davis do have a history of, how shall I put it, not having a f**king clue about how the world of trade works and so they may genuinely believe their lines. May is unknown. I don't have a clue what she actually thinks. Either way, I view the game theory scenario as naive; these people are ideologues who have long demonstrated they don't do detail (read John Redwood's blog for evidence of that). Moreover, they've built incredibly high expectations in the UK in the process of their plan and that's inevitably going to backfire if we actually want a deal and need to compromise to get it.The only sensible point I recently saw Davis make is that the EU sequencing can't make sense when it comes to NI. Discussing EU nationals and financial obligations before trade can work, but NI? NI border is fundamentally about trade. It's hard to see the EU's strict sequencing standing up here, and  that 3rd issue may be where the EU's definition of 'reasonable progress' on the initial issues before a future framework on trade can be discussed may be met.",dil0u71,dikhpoo,6fdlca,6.19E-07,-0.999998762,Against,07-06-17

19925,6,mynewsfilter,"Hey, thanks, I am glad you like it. Please verify it however as my understanding of your politics is somewhat limited. I am an immigrant myself and I arrived to your country from Poland 11 years ago. Now your country has changed a lot and I am naturally trying to get my head around it so please correct me if I am wrong or if my level of understanding of this greatest political scam in modern history of Britain is incorrect (apologise if my impression is wrong - please correct me if you have better understanding).My first observation is that ""Brexit means Brexit"" - this is a real thing and it will happen, regardless. Tories have strong ties with Rupert Murdoch and his media empire (I remember some Tory helped him to avoid prison sentence for the phone hacking scandal but don't remember the details, it's been a while...) so he is supporting them in the elections - which means they can't lose, despite all the critics, ignorance, odd statements and all embarassment they caused (read all links and material I provided earlier).Here is some info about the media circulation in the UK (scary!):https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_the_United_Kingdom_by_circulation#2010_to_presentAs you can see, the most media coverage in this country belongs to Murdoch's (rights wing?) empire and they ingenuously orchestrated UK's departure from the EU. I do not read that kind of press because I consider them to be full of hatred and they are presenting blured and incorrect information. Mostly. But majority (as it turns) of people are reading this and it shapes their opinions. Imformation presented in those type of media mostly rely on largerly false ""data"" and is perfectly designed to trigger very basic emotions. This worked perfectly to trigger the Brexit.Someone suggested that I ""advocate not voting for May"". Yes, I do. I can't see the reason why I should advocating voting for her (I tried to explain that in the post above).No one asked me (and other immigrants) before what I (we) think about this situation so I am trying to understand as much as possible.Personally I think Brexit is a disaster for this country - for many reasons, and please forget for a moment that I am an immigrant. I am speaking as a human living in this country, working and paying taxes. Brexit and Tories are good for rich and super rich. It will be extremely expensive for the poor and middle (not so rich) class (poor don't realize that as yet). They (as well as the next generations) are the ones that will have to pay the bill after all. We do not see the impact of weak pound yet but we will start seeing it very soon (usually in a situation like that there is about 1 year delay when things starting to pick up - and this is about now so by best advice is: fasten your seatbelts).Theresa May already stated that she will not raise the taxes for rich, she refused to make the same statement for not-so-rich:Tories vow not to increase income tax for UK's richest: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-tory-tax-policy-rise-income-tax-national-insurance-higher-earners-general-election-2017-a7770581.htmlBusinesses are moving to other countries because of the uncertainty, which is obvious. My another observation on that matter is the fact that world has changed massively in a recent years and UK doesn't have as many advantages as they used to have in the past. Other countries will be ready to pick up in no time, which will cause even more businesses to move away. This will cause a lot of problems and a chain reaction - problems in one industry will cause problems in another industry and in another... We will not see it overnight though, there is always a delay. When you wake up, it'll be too late for you as these changes are irreversible. Shame but you did this to yourself... and trust me, personally I am a rather optimistic individual, usually.I am not writing this for any personal gain nor because I am scared (as an immigrant) or anything like that. In the actual fact, Brexit is good for me personally for many reasons... I feel it is wrong however for this country, for the Europe and the whole region in a long run. We are only strong when we are together, in my opinion. But where someone is losing, somebody else is gaining. Watch the space...Please comment and correct me if I am wrong but this is my basic understanding.Let's all hope for ""Strong and Stable""... or not?Take care...",dilq2oj,dijiu4f,6fkv04,3.43E-05,-0.999931463,Against,08-06-17

19935,6,amgiecorker,"good question.  I will link a long post that has evidence (maybe worth reading the summary of that, but is says stuff like this below - I've just woken up so this may not be totally coherent :).  90% of economists think that brexit will be bad for the uk.  one brexit favoured think tank produced a report using a weird mishmash of methods, which said we'd need to remove a lot of workers rights, and - extremely - remove all tariffs.   That's the one that the Tories and Tory press used to sell brexit to the people. (The LSE said of it: ""If this sounds crazy, thatâ€™s because it is crazy.""). It is a wild outlier - predicting growth by using extreme changes to the fabric of the UK.  So, that evidence seems to increase the likelihood that Tories would do the cliff edge approach.  (The cliff edge, WTO, is slightly less extreme than the report the extreme right approach they are worshipping, above).  Especially, because if they let it run and run (negotiations) they may end up losing the chance to exit at all (we have a variety of negative economic impacts over the next few years. population have been lied to: the two don't mix well over time).  Cliff edge/WTO rules is in their manifesto, and really important to remember, brexit is their baby (they created it and promoted it, then removed anyone from cabinet who was going to stop it) so if we vote for them, we give them a mandate to pursue really extreme ideas. If you mix in this attitude from the Tories (from a while back, but contemporary still) then you can maybe see why I think Tory majority is terrifying (everything they do, lack of details (Duncan Smith says they're trying to get away from (he originally said, what they are trying to get away 'with!), that old fashioned thing of putting details into manifestos! how are we supposed to know what they are doing then?), even the timing of this election): ""Mr Davis on Monday said there was no question of giving MPs a vote on the governmentâ€™s negotiating position or on the activation of Article 50; Mrs May says she wants to begin exit talks by the end of March 2017 at the latest.""Where a vote of MPs is mentioned, in like 2019 (or much later), the Tories said the options will be ""take the deal and leave"" or ""don't take the deal (WTO) and leave"" - not much of a choice at all. Tories are clearly most willing to do extreme brexit - all the other parties have ruled it out.  To put it another way, you have much more idea what you will get by voting for the other parties.  For me, the Tories are putting them selves above democracy (subverting the tools of democracy to achieve it)****here's the labour opinion on it. (other parties below).  Labour tied them selves in knots a bit on brexit vote but are certainly trying to get a safer exit than May's. they didn't promise a 2nd ref, but in a hung parliament, would be obliged to act with others who do want one. ""Theresa May says no deal is better than a bad deal. Letâ€™s be clear: â€˜no dealâ€™ is in fact a bad deal. It is the worst of all deals because it would leave us with World Trade Organisation tariffs and restrictions instead of the access to European markets we need.That would mean increased tariffs on all the goods we export. That would put us at serious risk of having key manufacturers leaving the UK for the European Union, taking skilled jobs with them.A Labour Government will prioritise jobs and living standards, build a close new relationship with the EU and protect workersâ€™ rights and environmental standards.""Labour would have the ex director of public prosecutions (Sir Starmer I think): so they have credible people. ****Lib dems promise a 2nd ref on the eventual deal.  they hate brexit and are the most pro EU.  Lib Dem criticism comes amid Treasury estimates a clean EU break could leave a Â£66bn hole in UK financesTheresa May would be guilty of â€œan act of sheer economic vandalismâ€ if she pursues a hard Brexit, according to Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron, Mr Farron said: â€œ[Treasury estimates of cliff edge costs] is yet more proof that hard Brexit would be an act of sheer economic vandalism. We cannot stand by while this reckless, divisive and uncaring Conservative government wrecks the UK economy.â€or more recently: ""Have no doubt, Theresa May will get us a bad Brexit deal â€“ and I mean dementia tax bad. Thatâ€™s why I believe you should have the final say over the deal. Not Theresa May, not the politicians, you. And if you donâ€™t like the deal youâ€™re being offered, you should be able to reject it and choose to remain.""****Can't find specific comments from greens on cliff edge, but they hate brexit (are you noticing a trend?!, I'm sure Lucas said cliffedge was stupid, but too dozy to successfully search for it).  and promise a 2nd ref ""Thatâ€™s why today weâ€™re making clear our desire for a ratification referendum on the final deal, which includes an option for Britain to remain in the EU. Almost everyone has accepted Parliament should vote on the final deal, so why not make it truly democratic by opening it up to the people, with the option of staying in the EU?""http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/green-party-brexit-second-referendum-caroline-lucas-final-deal-a7712881.html****Guardian reporting a poll (what the people think)""A clear majority of the British public oppose Theresa Mayâ€™s uncompromising Brexit negotiating position and are not prepared for the UK to crash out of the EU if the prime minister cannot negotiate a reasonable exit deal, according to a new poll.""""In a sign that public support for the governmentâ€™s push for a hard Brexit is increasingly precarious, just 35% of the public said they backed Britain leaving the EU without an agreement with other states. The UK would then fall back on to World Trade Organisation (WTO) tariffs, which MPs and business leaders have claimed would devastate the economy.""https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/feb/11/theresa-may-hard-brexit-public-backlash-icm-pollhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/brexit-election-2017-keir-starmer-talks-eu-labour-corbyn-wins-theresa-may-tories-lose-a7770306.htmlthat long post. https://www.reddit.com/r/brexit/comments/6fkv04/the_things_the_tories_are_carefully_not_telling/",dim5xx0,dilq6yl,6ftiun,1.30E-20,-1,Against,08-06-17

19937,6,amgiecorker,"'My first observation is that ""Brexit means Brexit""'This is not true. The EU said at the start of this election very clearly, that if someone gets into power who doesn't want brexit, then we just drop it, no red tape. all good.  Many people are not aware of this it seems.   I think we may have fallen/believed all the soundbites. (somewhere I pointed out, that if the Tories after referendum had said, ""ok, we voted to leave, we will look into it, it is complicated, we'll get more info, debate, negotiate, and then we'll give you a 2nd ref"" the country would have been much happier and more stable recently (Instead they ranted ""brexit means brexit, will of the people, etc, etc"" in a very irresponsible way.  Whatever the outcome of this election, something like 60% of voters (give or take), will NOT have voted for the Tories - there is no unification being offered by the Tories here unless they promised a 2nd ref, which they won't)Rupert Murdoch: all I know is he has said he dislikes the EU because they can control him (he has little influence - other than the poisonous one he's been exerting for years); he doesn't mind our national politicians as he is the king maker (the backing of his papers, has big influence on who is elected: due partly to our very weak press regulation, which won't be fixed any time soon if the Tories get in, because they are the ones who benefit from it).  I hope one day, for this trend to be stopped, and there is hope because....The Internet; the rise of digital literate people; these should help free us from such manipulation in the future (and will have an impact on this election I hope)Yes on right wing papers; they have by far the biggest readership, and I've read that their readers are most likely to vote. (their paper sets their agendas at least, gets them thinking about certain issues, and gets them riled up, so they are less apathetic than people who aren't being manipulated by their papers)""Not the Tories"" is my only mantra - a hung parliament, or a tiny tory majority, is our best chance of avoiding the Torie's unpleasant plans, which they haven't fully outlined (that alone, is reason not to vote for them: they put hard brexit (the worst one) in their manifesto, and brexit is their extreme baby, so I think they would do it;  and ignorance of democratic process.   The MP vote (2019 or later) will be do you want this Tory deal; or do you want no deal.  That's no choice.  All the other parties are softer(safer) and more democratic or likely, to be more democratic on brexit. Yes, 90% of economists say it will have many negative impacts; May's hard brexit they say would have very very bad impacts.   Tories are always about business - they want reduced worker rights, reduced controls, possibly no Tariffs, reduced human rights.  I don't think any of that is right. (just look at the state of our NHS and schools - on some measures we are the 5th richest global economy - why on earth can't we create better education and health than this? - on NHS it is because we have one of the lowest funded western health services, and that is a tory decision. I believe they want business to take over the NHS) me too on optimism, usually. I don't do politics usually either. stakes are very high this time around though (beyond politics), so I got a bit more active. Some opinions say that membership of the EU is so sensible for us, that we would inevitably re-join.  I think that's likely. but if May gets in, the tories will do a lot of damage first.  I'm just not seeing any credible evidence of positive impacts of brexit (in this generation at least - and that time frame is too far to predict); and lots and lots of negative impact evidence.  also, I see so many benefits to EU membership, and it costs remarkably little. I'm glad you're not scared; so sorry our crappy papers sometimes pick on migrants. In my personal experience, we often get the brightest people from other countries into the UK (the most intelligent, people who contribute tax to our GDP). I do understand some areas (with immigrants from anywhere) become a bit 'them and us' but that's usually in deprived areas - would be better for everyone, if we could stop the areas being deprived.  Corbyn has made humane decisions on EU residents one of his first priorities - I think I read, he would just guarantee your rights without negotiating (a much better start to negotiations with the EU, imo, given our very poor hand of cards : May approach is more like ""if you don't give me everything I want, I will cut my own leg off""; not very intelligent).  I hope for reduced or no Tory majority.  The polls say otherwise, so hope can only be held gently and I will not be at all surprised by a large tory majority (partly because, the people I know who vote tory, have no rational reason for doing so - it seems to be fear, or lack of information, that is making them do that).  But it's been a strange election, so ...I guess we just have to wait and see.   UK has become quite extreme right wing; that will at some stage, swing back to a better, more balanced position - but I don't yet know how long that will take.

19960,6,amgiecorker,"that was trickier to answer than I thought, so this may be a bit waffly.  some valid points here though I think. I had exactly this thought earlier :) ""but that just means that they are aware that their plans will fuck the country - which isn't much consolation."" - either way, the Tories are being idiots but I feel they must have a goal (some parts of Minford, plus something a bit like hong kong, etc - you just don't push this hard, unless you have a goal).   Guaranteed crappy outcome with the tories either way, Extreme right wing changes with little scrutiny, significant incompetence, and a long decline in our economy as they splash around begging for trade deals from anyone.   I don't actually have to write anymore than that to answer your question! No one is as bad as the Tories right now.  Strange mixture of authoritarian Napoleon complex may, pretty insane ideas, incompetence, demonising others, dishonesty and lack of collaboration seems to sum them up.   so here's a scenario (which I think possible); economy starts tanking soon, much more than anyone expected due to the many interactions that were hard to map, people get scared - what do the Tories do; what does Labour do?  I don't know tbh, but I'd rather Labour of the two (they're not so insane, they haven't spent the last year tricking many of the population, brexit is not their crazy baby, and they were - eventually - more honest than the Tories about the likely economic damage)And would a labour majority be similarly dangerous to a Tory one?  I don't think so.  Labour have committed to not doing a hard brexit - how they square that with free movement will indeed be interesting to witness ( I assume they are eyeing a Ukraine type deal which (from memory) meets the goals, and is much safer than turning our back (I seem to remember the tories said they definitely weren't going to do these types of deals, but may be misremembering))- it gives us time to form trade agreements whilst sustaining existing trade).  They have much more concern and respect for things like education (Erasmus) and (I think) protection of consumers, so over all, we're likely to get a much softer brexit.   I think in particular, the mixture of all this will shorten the period in which our GDP under performs, although I still think leaving at all is rationally unjustifiable. Labour's apparent democratic party agreement on trident may be a positive sign; I don't want to swing from extreme right to extreme left, but the ability to reach that type of agreement, coupled with Corybn's close relationships with members and workers, should help Labour remain closer to the centre than the Tories are. They've said the first thing they will do is guarantee the rights of our current EU migrants (that is appropriate and humane; there's 3 million people affected, and some that I know, are very scared; it would also slow the current damaging exodus of workers and would improve relations with the EU overnight); they are committed to negotiating sensibly rather than just standing outside no. 10 threatening (bluffing with a hand that everyone involved knows, is really bad) which is an approach that has much greater chance of leading to a decent compromise on immigration; Labour will not remove workers rights with the same freedom and glee of the Tories; they have better people in their negotiating team than the strange menagerie the Tory's have managed to pull together.   I'm concerned that they didn't promise a 2nd ref (democracy clearly seems to require it); that may be a ploy, or it may be the actual plan, but the Tories have in comparison - in actions and words - made it clear they don't give a toss about democracy.   I think Corbyn is a genuine leaver though (whilst his members, wanted to stay, and that explains partly whey they got into such a mess around brexit).  I am concerned about unions funding labour; but bankers funding Tories, have definitely proved they are at least as dangerous (more so, I think, sub prime etc)A labour majority will definitely not happen though; what I'm hoping for - what I think the UK needs badly right now - is no majority.  Then the libs, the greens etc (the centre ground), have a valid say in what happens, they wouldn't allow something as sweeping as the great repeal bill in transferring powers from parliament to executive (deeply dangerous - but it might not be needed anymore if we stay single market member as above) and they will push for the 2nd ref as part of any collaboration. If it all really tanks, then this sort of compromise arrangement would be easier to reverse as well. The main risk to that, is that the Tories have put us into a terrible mess - will get worse; will they manage to blame the people trying to sort their mess out for the tory mess?  They might.  Another risk is indeed whether those groups can all work together; what will the election hot air around working together actually boil down to in reality?   I don't know; but as we both seem to agree, the tories are running around cutting the hamstrings of our economy left right and centre - the sooner that stops, the better.

You are absolutely right that this process has been dominated by a very emotionally charged set of positions on all sides, and anyone who has ever been in a heated argument knows that that tends not to lead to optimal outcomes.We have had the pre-referendum campaigns where facts and informed arguments were demonised. Then, after June, we had a chance to fill the decision with meaning and enter into a national debate of what we actually want from brexit. That chance was lost in the aftermath of the divisive campaign, which left the positions ossified. Not even the formal triggering of Art. 50 led to a better understanding and presentation of the complexities ahead. The snap election gave me hope that finally a proper national debate could be held, especially if it could be validated by plebiscite at the end of it. Both Labour and Conservatives avoided the issue almost entirely - future generations may well replace the phrase ""the elephant in the room"" with ""the looming brexit"" - and the clock continues to tick.I sincerely hope that this long overdue discussion can now be held rationally, on all sides, with well-informed arguments as well as a healthy dose of respect for the british self-image and the resulting complexities. And then, when a clear picture has been communicated to both the country and our partners across the channel (who often have as much trouble understanding the british psyche as brits have trouble to understand the drivers and motivations behind e.g. the german position) I hope we have the necessary backbone to give the people the chance to re-affirm their commitment to leave the EU in a second referendum, as befits a decision of such magnitude and impact.

20039,6,amgiecorker,"So, as election result almost in, what happens next? here's a starter for 10. I'm just thinking what might happen next; here's my ballpark attempt.  The most ideological leavers may be unhappy at the moment (and I am sorry for any upset; would rather everyone was happy); for the rest of us, the majority, I strongly believe we've dodged a bullet - The Tories were getting close to facism in the overall sum of their ideas, and it would be wrong for most of us to have our future defined *solely* by autocratic extremism.  The UK at our best, is much more balanced than that. This whole post is a first pass when we still haven't got full results and politicians will say new stuff over the next few days. I may be wrong about some parts so best to treat it as a starter for 10.  But it still feels useful to attempt it now, because for brexit impact on the whole UK, this new development is almost certainly positive (so, here's some reassurance hopefully). May declared it was the Brexit election(as per recent post) Davis said (yesterday) that their manifesto contained promises ""to leave the customs union and single market"" and that we would see today ""whether [people] have accepted that or not. That will be their decision.""Turns out, people have not accepted it.  I'm not sure what happens now; we might still get a Tory government + DUP + someone else who will try to push the same plans (full results not in yet: 5:30am on 9th).  I think the mandate has been so badly damaged though, that this would be problematic: as per Davis, the Tories would have to get a new mandate. Or we might get a labour minority gov trying to push their manifesto. (in this scenario, it is highly likely that we'd have to get a 2nd ref - labour would need the greens and lib dems and snp on board - if labour didn't offer 2nd ref, we'd be back to a very weak Tory coalition I believe, who would not have any valid mandate for negotiating brexit- they just asked for one on their rough plans and more than 50% of the country said no).  Here's a rough attempt to compare labour with Tory.  (mainly from http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39665835).  this will be a bit rough I'm afraid, and parts may change as we go through the next week or so, but may be useful. The main thing to note, is that this is much less extreme than the Tory ideas (the Tories were extreme; ideological; looking to cut our mooring ropes at the same time as trying to weave sails from threads they were plucking from old jumpers (taking 10 to 20 years) as we careened around on a rocky lee shore) - some variant of the below feels much safer.   There are existing deals which could, under labour, be used as models (Norway, Ukraine, etc) so its possible the labour approach would shorten the amount of time our GDP falls for by years compared to the Tory one. Labour vs (Tory)Protecting all existing workers' rights, consumer rights and environmental protections  (the Tories seem to say they would keep workers rights, but I find it hard to believe that would last - remember they also wanted full powers, for just the cabinet (or just May) to change our laws at will, and their economic model was all about de-regulation: if they weren't going to reduce rights eventually, their brexit made even less sense)Aiming for ""tariff-free access"" to the EU single market, while accepting ""unchanged access"" is impossible (The tories wanted to become a free trade global hub; that means logically, that the EU couldn't let us have free access to the EU markets as well - this is the unicorn part of the whole tory plan - fairly stupidly unrealistic (imo))Leaving the option of the customs union on the table (The tories were clear, leave the customs union, causing massive extra costs and disruption at borders and moving away from free trade (that's the thing that's helped us prosper since we joined the EU))Refusing to accept a ""no deal"" scenario (to the Tories, the cliff edge scenario (the one most likely to cause recession) would have been coherent with their main economic model - the one that 90% of economists thought was rubbish - I'm paraphrasing a bit here, but it is fundamentally accurate)No second referendum on the final deal - but giving MPs a decisive say on what happens next (to be clarified what this means; I hope labour will be more democratic - the tories we know as a fact, were steam rolling democracy)Guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals living and working in the UK to stay in the country from ""day one"" (Tories were refusing to do this, causing a lot of pain: doing this would help our negotiations with the EU, not hurt them (the tories were bluffing a lot, with a very bad hand, and the EU knew it)No target numbers for migration levels (who the hell knows what the Tories were doing? caps, but that was political - immigration basically can't change much as our economy would suffer - The Tories would have had to accept immigration, or at least foreign workers, as part of their trade deals with places like India.  my personal feeling, is that immigration won't change much but we'll have to wait and see)Remaining in EU schemes like Erasmus and the 80bn euro (Â£69bn) Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (unclear to me right now what Tories wanted, but academia were certainly terrified about losing these under the Tories)Protecting EU structural funding for the rest of the Parliament (don't know what tories were doing on this - they were wriggling a lot about paying any bill, so it may have been threatened)A ""presumption of devolution"" whereby devolved powers transferred from Brussels will automatically go to devolved nations and regions (ok, copy and paste it sounds like, but without the Tory's dangerous insistence on the cabinet being able to change whatever laws they wanted by just telling parliament that they're changing them)I don't at the moment see the point in another election myself; how would the result be any different? would we then have *another* election if we still didn't have a majority?  and mean time, our economy keeps on crashing (please note now, for just fairness, and for the avoidance of future attempts by a possible opposition Tory party to blame our incoming economic low performance on any coalition, our economy thanks to the TORY policy is already performing worse than all in EU, including Greece, and that downward course will continue for now - economies like glaciers, takes a while to budge them)also, I must say one other thing.  This Brexit has been nasty for many people - millions scared about their future; millions feeling unwelcome; UK pensioners in EU watching their pension payments fall; and clear evidence has emerged over the last few months that economic decline has started (and will persist until the future is more clear).Brexit is also economically very damaging; we are going to pay a price for what the tories have done. And if there had been as much effort as their was in this election (at fact sharing, getting input from young people, etc) on the brexit ref, then we almost certainly wouldn't have left - there was good evidence that by (I think it was) 2020, demographics (brutally, old people dying and young people being able to vote) the same turnout would have voted to stay (that was in the FT a while back)So I must provide these links  (only for anyone who doubts what I say next); the daily mail, the sun, in particular, plus other Tory papers to lesser degree, were absolutely complicit with the tories in attempting to manipulate us into voting leave (because Paul Dacre wanted it; because Rupert Murdoch wanted it; because the Tory's rich backers wanted it; because it was ideological for the Tories).  I mention this, because we become a more stable society as more people realise this.

20045,6,amgiecorker,"I'm puzzled; I can't remember why we're leaving the EU. (I've added a quick summary of the responses at the bottom of this OP)Can anyone remind me why we're leaving the EU? EU membership doesn't really cost us anything once we consider the gdp benefits it brings. (net costs 0.4% of GDP; the government's business department costs four times that; defence 8 times that (CBI source)) Our MEPs work the same way as our MPs: you just contact them with your requests The EU stops wars happening in Europe (EU won the Nobel peace prize in 2012)The EU protects consumers from the worst excesses of capitalism (safety standards on foods, etc)The EU's stability means long term battles (i.e. climate change) can be sustained (national commitments to good actions, come and go every election)Free movement of people applies to the UK citizens as much as anywhere else; if we don't establish a less extreme version of brexit soon, then we may wish we still had the freedom to go and pluck chickens, or conduct brain operations, in other parts of Europe.  It also makes holidays in the EU easier. On a related note, the economy requires immigrants; if we leave they'll just come from other places. (UK<>elsewhere trade agreement would have come with requirement to allow foreign worker entry) EU membership creates more consumers for UK free trade exports (standards of living rise with EU membership)EU has more weight than the solitary UK to create advantageous and morally acceptable trade agreements with the rest of the world, which all 28 then benefit from. UK is more influential inside Europe (we get credit and respect for stopping the spread of Nazis)UK in the EU is a bridge into Europe (we attract more foreign investment as a result; and more respect from the World: US special relationship is based on this)Our industry, research and academia gets access to billions of pounds of investment funding through the EU. If our bones start hurting, we can easily retire somewhere warm where our sterling(used to) go further, with usually, minimal problems and zero or small cost of healthcare.Our young people can travel and study abroad easily, sometimes with financial assistance (i.e. housing) providedThe EU membership, and their courts, provide some protection from deranged national politicians (ahem. I'm saying nothing. we never have those ) - because the EU is more stable (wisdom of the crowds) than national government. etc.etc.I'm a bit puzzled; I'm not sure why we thought leaving was a good idea. *edit: added some extra suggestions to the bottom of the list; also to say, I will try to keep any of my own response below to ones that I have already evidenced elsewhere in this sub - i.e. try to keep it pretty fact based.   also the above list is deliberately simple; people including me, don't read complex; clarified gdp quote as net; and sorry, some language and anger crept in*****summary of reasons why, that were suggested*****I like the EU, and I'm rushing, so there will be some bias in my summary.  Also a lot of straight facts though.  Thanks again to contributors; feel free to pm me if I've missed anything seriously significant. to me, the main reasons ""why"" seem to be political ideologies (far right *and* far left, combining to mean there was very little opposition from the top, to the idea of leaving) and very strong agenda setting by the same Eurosceptic media owners, who tend to back the politicians who win elections (there seems to be strong links between politicians and media owners).  There are also certainly some ideological 'leavers' in the UK who have been encouraged to make arguments, convince people, but the number really is essentially very small (11% in 2014). Press regulation.  Media owners (Tory especially) have set the agenda to be all about immigration, and some hazily defined taking back of control.  That has meant all the good things the EU does have had less presence/impact in any debate.   This is the essence of the 'it was an emotional decision rather than a rational one' explanation.Poor knowledge of the EU.  UK people have among the worst knowledge of what the EU does, of all EU citizens.  Our most inaccurate papers, are the most read.  So we don't have much buffer of good factual knowledge with which to recognise attempted manipulations of our opinions. Lies and manipulations from our politicians.  famous lies about positive impact from leaving on our NHS; also a lot of manipulations (politicians and media praised the positive economic predictions (minority opinions) and dismissed loudly the negative predictions (90% of economists)). Democracy/will of the people.  Only 37% of voters voted to leave; our government then parrots ""brexit means brexit"" as if that actually meant anything; our government then had to be taken to court to allow MPs any further say, at which point the party leaders forced reluctant MPs to vote for article 50.  Neither of our main parties will give a 2nd referendum.   Brexit has not been pursued because democracy demands it happens, more because the party leaders want it to happen. Tactics of remain campaign during referendum have been criticised (focused on creating fear of leaving, rather than benefits of staying). The opposition party also did very little real opposition (because they are too far left; they like the idea of leaving). Because UK has had years of austerity, and many years of under investment in infrastructure.  this seems to be true; people were glad to be able to blame a lack of jobs on immigrants. (ironically, the EU creates jobs in our most deprived areas; those jobs disappear when funding stops)Immigration.  Was used as an emotive reason, an agenda worked hard by the Tory papers, but in reality we know our economy will require immigrants from somewhere (if not the EU, then elsewhere) and eventually I think, we realised freedom of movement adds a lot to tax take, and is crucial to various economic sectors. Incompetent UK politicians.  They were very reckless to launch article 50 (ticking clock) with no real plan on a very weak mandate (from a project point of view, this approach was always going to lead to a mess); that's more them being greedy though (seize the chance that they don't think will come round again)Because we let an ill informed public vote. The referendum was advisory.  It is the politicians who made the mess of it; they went ""brexit means brexit"" and charged ahead, when they should have been more honest, open and democratic (""Ok, advisory result in, we'll explore it, develop some options/timescales/costs, and get back to you"", would have been better response). Because we want to trade with the rest of the world more. We can, and do, do that in the EU; EU already working on the same sort of trade agreements our Tories wanted (though from a more moral stance than our gov was going to take).   doesn't seem very convincing argument, unless you accept Tories were going to deregulate everything (which involves massive changes to the UK which were certainly not part of the referendum mandate) because the EU is undemocratic. this is quite often said. In essence though, I believe it is not true.  UK gets proportional say to its number of citizens and every EU country has a veto on majority decisions;  the EU commission and unelected officials are often quoted, but we have similar (not exactly the same I know) in our own civil service.   and it is not as if our own democracy works very well (as proven recently); EU democracy is more evolved if anything (i.e. built on the lessons learned from the national democracies), using PR for elections, etc whereas UK's democracy has tenants created many hundreds of years ago. because the EU is corrupt.  No more so than our own politicians; and any odd lobbying of the EU would just move to the UK, if we moved the EU's function to the UK.   more a problem with humans than with the EU. Because we want the UK to be great again. We were great in the 70s apparently, so lets go back to then; also really good when we had an empire, so lets do empire 2.0.   These both ignore that the world has moved on - globalisation, digital convergence onto the internet, empowerment of individuals to achieve massive things, making borders less important rather than more, global citizenship as a concept, etc.  They also ignore the fact that by leaving, we make ourselves smaller, not bigger, and the fact that the EU is already working on FTAs with our target commonwealth countries.  Far right free trade hub fantasy exists, but is based on the EU simply giving the government everything they ask for (often quoted as belief in unicorns).   Its most extreme form also required massive changes to the UK (workers rights, gender rights, a death of manufacturing, etc) which weren't talked about during referendum.  I believe in Britain is the soundbite used by politicians, but I would say those who think the UK can collaborate, openly, influence and succeed in the EU, believe in Britain more.

By contrast, for the UK, the losses could be highly significant, over ten times greater as a share of GDP."" and ""All studies agree that the losses will be considerably larger for the UK than forthe EU27.""your last paragraph is interesting.  I'm trying to be balanced, but it is impossible on this point.  The Tories created brexit; they want it; they have steam rolled democracy; launched article 50 with no public/democratic agreement of a model (which is insanely reckless imo); they seem to be dreaming of an extreme far right model where it doesn't matter much if we crash out (to them it doesn't; to the public it will, very much so); that or they seem to believe in unicorns, and that the EU is obliged to give them a unicorn because they said they wanted one, and their negotiating approach seems only to be to antagonise and threaten when (see above) everyone knows if the EU hurts a bit, we crash and burn.  And still, having lost their attempt at a mandate (no majority, less than 50% of the vote, will of the people doesn't apply *this time* apparently), they wriggle on, oozing nonsense platitudes and making a deal with one of the least tolerant parties instead of allowing any democratic involvement.   If ever there was a case for simply dissolving a political party, or dismissing politicians for negligence (not just one, all the brexit idiots), this must be a good one (I'm not serious about dissolution, but just because it would hurt the UK)So thanks to our politicians (Labour were very very bad on article 50 as well, but the Tories seem positively demented) we've not had any debate or discussion of models that might actually work yet.  Labour's approach, as you probably know, to brexit is more safe and less impossible than that of the Tories, they wish to retain some of the EU systems you allude to, and it could I understand be based on one of the existing models so that would I think, cut down the years of uncertainty (GDP damage), but the labour refusal of a 2nd ref means they are again, failing to be democratic. They haven't got a mandate either.If we are not following any model, but wish to follow your suggested approach, then I assume negotiation time (and hence damage) becomes much longer. The tories need to back off; let democracy happen.  they've failed.  Until that happens, we can't have any debate of what model is best; and there *will* need to be a 2nd ref as well once we know which of the EU benefits we keep, which we lose, and what the benefits to us are.

20107,6,TwosipsTony,"I'm British and I voted to leave the EU.The EU to me is not the shining beacon of hope that it is conveyed to be usually on the left wing social media/media/ Reddit so on. To me Britain is more important that the EU, Italy is more important than the EU, Germany is more important than the EU, all 28 nations currently in the EU are bigger and deserve more credit than they are given.If we think of what a sovereign nation is, it governs itself and its people. In terms of monetary policy, natural and agricultural policy, law making, border control. In this system, that appears to be waining in Europe, ensures the voters and majority of that nation are best served by their government.Currently you cannot elect any of the 4 presidents, the only directly elected officials in the EU are the EU parliament where 751 MEP sit representing all 28 nations. However, this is the only parliament in the world that you cannot propose a new bill (law) because it lacks legislative power. Now why does this matter? Are the laws really that bad? What difference does this make? Well we cannot forget the importance of democracy and how loosing this power can have detrimental effects. If this doesn't matter to you, then I don't know what has happened to the minds of people. People have fought numerous wars in both a international and civil sense, protested for the right to vote and be given the power to fire and hire those in power. They need to be answerable to YOU. EVERY 5 years in the U.K. We go to the ballot box and elect the party that we believe will be the most beneficial to the county. After those 5 years it happens again, if you like what they have done you can give them their job again. However, if you don't, you can fire them and pass the power onto another party. The party we elect controls our law making, however currently any E.U law is superior to national law. There is nothing you can do as a voter, to change these laws. And I hope you understand the severity of that. I don't see the EU as Europe, and I don't consider Britain above any other European nation as we are one world in this together. But i am saddened by how deceiving the EU can appear. It's idea is wonderful, but when it makes mistakes its leaders cannot be removed from power and that scares me.Yes the costs aren't terrible, but when you see the Â£300m space egg unveiled in Brussels, and shopping centres in the European institutions while we see the crisis Europe faces today, this is wrong to me. And I'd rather our taxes be used on something more beneficial no matter how small or large the amount, however, there is no way for me to have a say in this (can't vote)The EU doesn't stop wars happening, trade does. The EU is not the reason for peace, it's proven that the more countries trade with one another, the more at peace they are. Now the EU has an excellent free trading network INTERNALLY. The EU's single market is great for inter EU nation trade as there are zero barriers. However in order for the EU to protect its businesses from external competition, it places costs on importing products into the EU (different amounts depending on the type of import), it can also do other things such as limiting volume of imports (quotas). When you do this, the manufacturer from outside the EU has to charge you more inside the EU in order to pay for the import. Also the internal EU businesses don't need to worry about competition from the rest of the world, so they don't feel the need to either put their own costs down or innovate and improve the quality of their products. Basically you pay more for things inside the external market and our companies are less likely to be competitive.When we leave the EU, yes there maybe a few more forms to fill out in order to live and work in Germany and the same the other way. And they may ask us to have a certain amount of cash in our bank accounts in order for them to give us a living visa, and again, vice versa. However, it will still be possible to live there you just won't have the automatic right to do so. Regarding our own borders, all this talk of not having the workforce to supply us, is utter nonsense. The government you pick as a member of the British public will simply be in control. Control, doesn't mean shut the door, it just mean control. We don't have enough doctors? Great, allow in more doctors. And now we can. Have some faith in who we elect to take on this responsibility. Currently it's the office workers in Brussels that do that for us.And yes the EU does have more weight than the UK which I think is a shame. People are becoming more likely to call themselves European than British, and this saddens me. Basically it all comes down to the perspective on the E.U.

But I have run up against the same criticism which this has attracted here.   Having looked at various aspects, the problem here is the lack of centrist politics - labour and Tories both combined to launch article 50 because leaving the EU meets their more extreme goals; effectively, when they whipped their MPs (of whom large majority, did not want to leave)  both of them were chanting the dishonest Tory sound bite phrase ""brexit means brexit"".  If a centrist (or just a less greedy left or right wing party) had said, ""ok, we've voted to leave by a small margin.  We will explore this; it is going to take time; we'll talk to the EU, develop some options, be open about our plans, and the benefits, and let you decide which option we do (2nd ref, with an additional option of drop it and remain)"" then our country would be in much better shape.  Both parties were dishonest and greedy and have produced unnecessary division - and unnecessary economic damage which is only getting worse as we head for a likely further election - by avoiding absolutely necessary democratic process.   The Tories have been worse by a fair distance - so dishonest, so manipulative, aided by their press and they started the whole thing purely to keep their party together and to win votes from readers, of whom some had been biased by years of inaccurate Tory press coverage (we're among the worst informed in Europe about what the EU actually does, due to having some of the worst newspapers in Europe).  Labour have apparently moved a bit more to the centre than they were whist the Tories have accelerated their movement towards full facism.   so labour are better imo, and I would pick them of the two if I had to, but both are deeply culpable in causing unnecessary damage to our country for their own ends.

Some EU countries have embraced EU much more than us - maybe a legacy of our empire (we have a vague cultural memory that we're important on world stage). If so, the Tory's plans would have fixed that for the next generation  (by reminding them we are small  - that's not unpatriotic of course, (I've just realised how tired I am of defending against ridiculous arguments of (some) leavers who aren't thinking...not directed at you...me saying its no unpatriotic should not be required:) - and by making our economy smaller.   I think we'd have been better off becoming more European (but some papers sustained a long term anti eu campaign, which has not helped - apparently our papers are among the worst in being accurate about the EU), and even if we leave, and as we become less important in the world, our young people will be looking at EU and thinking, that is better and in due course, they'll get their chance to rejoin. generally just patriotism as a motivation is no longer relevant in our globalist world, also a bit logically and sometimes morally silly (my country, without consideration of right or wrong) in most cases.  international agreements of morality seem to be a good thing to me (geneva convention, human rights convention ,etc) likely to lead to better treatment of more people.Sovereign nation argument results in 'believe in Britain' soundbites.  hmm.

I dunno. but look at what has happened here - how democratic are we?  is democracy fit for purpose now?  haven't politicians stopped practising democracy already?  too many questions around the whole of democracy to be making it a strong argument for leaving the EU. similarly, we can't give much important to the EU being deceptive, given everything that our politicians get up to.  whatever system of governance we use will be exploited by humans for their own ends. External trade concerns; the EU are busy negotiating all sorts of FTAs with the same countries that the Tories wanted to (India, Oz, African ones, South American ones).  the EU is more attractive trade partner than the UK (as a whole- more people to sell stuff to) . (this was the basis of my weight point - 450 mill tops 60 mill people in spending power, bigger market, more positive impact on the country negotiating, more desirable to them so they will compromise more to get it).  we export many billions of pounds of products to non EU countries already (US at the top - in terms of individual countries, China ,UAE, etc - these figures might be a few years old though; just making the general point. thankyou for the case, made me think about a few things.

20147,6,TwosipsTony,"No problem, I'm glad you understand where I'm coming from. Thank you for making me think about my points.In terms of our importance on the world stage, I simply don't know the answer until this all has played out. However, I don't think at this stage we should dismiss the idea of a future we're we will stand tall on the world stage alongside the EU. I must say, (and I do not mean this disrespectfully) your words do play us down considerably. To list a few facts about the uk:Geographically located in a sweet spot for world tradeWe speak English (this is not me being too nationalist here, it is just a very helpful language in many factors of world affairs)Seat on G7 and G20World class Armed ForcesStrong position on he UN Security Council5th largest economyNow please understand with my above point, I am aware we are a small nation and we are no longer the top dogs so to speak on the world stage. And I argue quite rightly so. But I truly do not feel quite as pessimistic about leaves effect on our soft power as what I pick up from your words (forgive me if I've misunderstood you on this). I do of course accept that with less influence in Europe, this will likely have a negative effect on our soft power.However the point of world power, from my mind, does not trump the idea of national governance. How likely another country is to listen to us, to me personally, is just not as important as our domestic system of governance.Your argument is that, no matter what form of governance we adopt, politicians and government officials will always exploit the people and what we have now doesn't work.However the current system some could argue, dates back to the Magna Carta, recognising the rights of citizens. It has been developed through years and years of getting things wrong, in order to correct them. The European system is at maximum, half a century old, and that is being extremely generous.But, even if your point is correct, and our government is exploiting us. In 5 years time (presumably, if not less) you can say no more and vote for another party as mentioned previously. So to say that both systems do not work and then potentially choose the one which you have minimal control over is concerning to myself.I do not mind if we are a Hong Kong or Singapore in the shadow of Europe as long as I get a say in how 100% of my country is being governed. Some may call me fickle or silly for this, but it really does mean a great deal to me to have this.In terms of trade. Yes the EU are negotiating trade deals with the rest of the world. However, having to please 28 nations with different interests does frustrate the process. Although, this is a mute point, you quite rightly said, you do not need trade deals to trade with the rest of the world and we do in fact trade with countries a great deal that are outside the EU. In fact, the percentage of business done by British businesses outside the EU grows at double the rate of the business done inside.And in terms of our market, we are nowhere near the size of Europes 400 million, but we are still over 60 million people in a first world country. The car industry calls Britain ""treasure island"" because are consumers love to consume, we are worth a great deal to the world so do not underestimate this point by comparing it to a larger number. And yes Europe will be preferred by a country with any sense as they are a more worthwhile market, but this does not mean they will shun Britain. They can have an agreement with both and will want our 60 million people also.To go over, I do have a lot of faith in us for the future. I see his as an opportunity rather than a diminishing of Britain.So again, the above reasons you quite rightly put to me where considered in my vote but the above covers why they did not convince me to place my pencil on the remain box at the polling station.Thank you for your input, you have most certainly given me things to think about.",dir28oj,dir0fx5,6gb1ms,0.881003909,0.762007819,Brexit,11-06-17

I believe the two are complimentary: for national stuff, we follow our system; but we also have a democratic system to help create both beneficial trade and progressive policies in Europe.  On rare occasions we can be outvoted in the latter (87% or so of our votes are on the winning side in the EU); but that's just part of democratic government.  And the same standards that the EU follows (i.e. consumer protection, human rights protection, sane national governance) can be used by us to protect our selves (for example, we currently face another potential choice between two extremes, right and left; both of them are scary; if either of them went too far (too damaging to us in the UK, as EU citizens) then the EU can apply serious pressure.  The EU was designed to be complimentary to national governments, not to replace them, and my impression from reading bits of EU legislation (only bits, here and there) is that they've (we've rather..collectively) succeeded admirably (though not perfectly). related point (on magna carta etc), the EU system obviously learned lessons from all the national systems.  it's like the 500 year old powers May was (is?) trying to use to giver her ability to dictate to parliament - that sort of historic incompatibility with democracy would not be in the EU setup.   To sound bite it, the UK is running democracy 1.0; the EU is running democracy 2.0.  they are compatible, but newer versions are usually better. (UK MEPs are elected using proportional representation for example; many would argue that's better than our system).   Another related point, some of the corruption that the EU is accused of (lobbying etc) is because of the functions that happen there; if we exit, we just increase our own corruption in the same area (we then get plauged by lobbyists; they just won't be wearing suits quite as nice as the ones of the EU lobbyists, because we will be lower value market). You praise our ability to elect national representation; we have the same ability re: Europe - UKIP won the most of the our vote in 2014, so we sent more UKIP MEPs. (interestingly circa 26% of the vote).   We do have a smaller say in Europe, but I understand our say is proportional to our population size. seems fair.   The EU does have some unelected parts (like the commission) but they are mainly about implementing the will of the elected parts; also about ensuring stability of the EU (we simply couldn't derive the benefits of the EU, if the whole thing was elected every five years, similar to our civil service.I do not call you fickle or silly :)  to use the soundbite, you ""believe in Britain"".  I would argue ""I believe in Britain more"" (because I don't think we have to be insular; I think we can be a successful part of something much bigger, something that delivers much greater benefit to the world than we can alone) thankyou. If the politicians had debated in the way you are capable of doing, rather than just decreeing to meet their own goals (both left and right), the UK would be in a much more intelligent and stable place than it currently is.

The raid resulted in the deaths of 1,297 French servicemen, the sinking of a battleship and the damaging of five other ships.The combined air-and-sea attack was conducted by the Royal Navy in response to the Second Armistice at CompiÃ¨gne between Germany and France on 22 June, which had seen Britain's sole continental ally replaced by a collaborationist government administrated from Vichy. The new Vichy government had also inherited the considerable French naval force of the Marine Nationale; of particular significance were the seven battleships of the Bretagne, Dunkerque and Richelieu classes, which was the second largest force of capital ships in Europe after the Royal Navy. Since Vichy, which was created on 10 July 1940, one week after the attack, was seen by the British as a mere puppet state of the Nazi regime, there was serious fear that they would surrender or loan the ships to the Kriegsmarine, which could undo British naval superiority by giving the Axis an advantage in the Battle of the Atlantic.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/brexit/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index)   ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.2",div5gke,div5ghl,6h24li,0.999995619,0.999991239,Brexit,14-06-17

20445,6,APB2710,"There's a lot more nuance those points than you phrase it as.We'd in fact be able to leave the majority of EU policies (usefully explained here http://bit.ly/28V1CUN). We'd be left with the minimum law necessary for trading purposes, which in of itself has varying degrees of international origin anyway (interesting example here http://bit.ly/2rzmlGr). In raw number terms, the EFTA/EEA states currently have in force 5, 441 acts through the EEA Agreement (http://www.efta.int/eea-lex), which is about 27% of the around 20, 000 EU laws in force. When you think that policies like the CAP and CFP are exempt from the EEA, that makes sense. Either way, it certainly isn't most EU law that Norway and the others follow. Only a fraction.Moreover, we'd maintain a voice at an EU level, through co-decision rights and committee influence in the EU. The part we lose is the vote itself, though of course much law is formed in the preparatory stages before any voting, particularly single market law which is technical and often goes through the EU comitology process anyway.We would not be contributing directly to the EU budget; EEA contributions cover money towards the programs and agencies we choose to be a part of (for example, list of programs and agencies Norway participates in here http://bit.ly/2ruPPdw), as well as grants to poorer countries in the EEA (though once again, important to note Norway voluntarily pays a far higher grant amount as a form of soft power). None of this goes directly to the EU budget, it's actually a pretty fair pro-rata system. And never forget cross-border cooperation always costs money.And finally, on freedom of movement, you argue that would remain the same. Well, that one is trickier. But certainly, the EEA Agreement, which would be the basis for our relationship with the EU (http://bit.ly/1d4rKbQ), allows for non-EU EEA states to unilaterally limit free movement under article 112. Whether the UK could attempt to do this is subject to debate and you'd have to make up your own mind whether you agree with it (pro side here http://bit.ly/2sde8fE) but it certainly shouldn't be dismissed out of hand and is not something available to us as an EU member state.",diypmpr,diypejh,6hff4g,0.000885134,-0.998229733,Against,16-06-17

To argue it's ""simple"" to solve those issues is incredibly ignorant.As someone who has many friends and family members who are nurses in the NHS who already have to work a huge amount of overtime (unpaid) just to see that their departments don't collapse, and as someone who has worked for and with many higher-ups in the NHS who have and still are trying to bring much needed change within the organisation It is extremely infuriating to see such ridiculous misinformation about how simple it is to change things and how his ""solution"" will fix things ""overnight"" - it just doesn't work like that - it never has and never will, fact.The result of less foreign nurses applying to jobs will affect the NHS badly and will affect anyone who might need medical care in the coming years as more nurses come out of medical school and work their way up the ladder. It's clear to me that raising wages, even if it could happen overnight won't have a positive effect for a long time - when we're talking about a health care service that means people miss out on the care they require and have paid for through their taxes - potentially resulting in the avoidable death of many, or worse, the government seeing it as justification to finally scrap/privatise the NHS.

I do not think it is. the referendum advice to MPs was clear; ref was advisory. ""It does not contain any requirement for the UK Government to implement the results of the referendum, nor set a time limit by which a vote to leave the EU should be implemented. Instead, this is a type of referendum known as pre-legislative or consultative, which enables the electorate to voice an opinion which then influences the Government in its policy decisions.""There was an agreement to differ allowed for MPs - they could support whatever side they liked.  but that then ended with party whip on article 50, which goes against the duties of an MP. (Churchill, quoted at top of MPâ€™s parliamentary role description) 'The first duty of a member of Parliament is to do what he thinks in his faithful and disinterested judgement is right and necessary for the honour and safety of Great Britain. His second duty is to his constituents, of whom he is the representative but not the delegate. Burke's famous declaration on this subject is well known. It is only in the third place that his duty to party organization or programme takes rank.  (the majority of MPs, including May, knew it was a bad idea to leave: they went against their first duty)Notes by 3rd party attending one AC Grayling lecture, says it was made clear to MPs that if the advisory were otherwise, then it would need a super majority (but I haven't found primary evidence for this on a quick search)https://www.suffolkeualliance.co.uk/commentary/2017/6/8/professor-ac-grayling-at-suffolk-university-6th-june-2017The essence is clear though; Brexit means brexit was utter rubbish (manipulation; an attempt to claim a mandate which simply was not there) and the attempt to avoid parliamentary approval was illegal, but was useful in showing the Tory's approach.   What the ref vote meant was that parliament needed to discuss it further and adopt a sensible approach to exploring possibilities (something they've still not managed)Irrespective, parliament only gave permission to start negotiations, not to actually leave.  It has been clearly established legally that parliament holds sway over the executive (parliament is more powerful than the PM).  and it seems clear that an act of parliament would be required to withdraw once terms were known (May's MP's 'vote' on accept or don't accept, doesn't seem to meet the legal requirements).  It seems clear that parliament would have to give permission for talks to be allowed to fail as well (to crash out).  May's election has given her the opposite of a mandate which gives parliament and lords perfect right to block whatever her brexit geniuses manage to produce. (""she asked voters: â€œGive me a big majority so the Lords donâ€™t meddle with my Brexit plansâ€. And the voters answered: â€œNoâ€. In the circumstances, if the Lords block any government Brexit bills, they would not be frustrating the popular vote â€“ but rather giving effect to it."" http://eulawanalysis.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/the-gamble-that-failed-brexit-election.html)Much of May's behaviour has been aimed at manipulating parliament into doing whatever she wants.  There's serious concerns about that of course (parliament can stop her, it is clear, but that would require some valid opposition to brexit from the opposition)https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/blog/deal-or-no-deal-a-parliamentary-brexit-vote-and-the-two-level-gameOverall it is very clear: there is not, any mandate (not the ref, not the GE), for leaving the EU, and no mandate could be given by parliament when the terms of leaving, and impacts are not yet defined (so, not the article 50 bill either); and May's proposed approach to a final vote, could equally not give a valid mandate.It is possible, given Corybn and May as party leaders, that parliament will be forced to allow some deal through.  Again, much like all the lying, I do not think that would be an appropriate approach (agree to differ approach would be much more appropriate - a free vote, to all MPs to fulfil their duties).  and with such a feeble mandate, any newly resulting 'state' of the UK will be fragile and susceptible to change.",dj2q664,dj2eif2,6hzot4,1.03E-06,-0.999997945,Against,18-06-17

""""â€œLeave the EUâ€ was acceptable as a gauge of public opinion, but it was clearly not acceptable as a ballot paper option for a binding vote to â€œimplementâ€ specific action. Leave the EU - regardless of the consequences? Leave the EU - once you have established acceptable alternatives? Leave the EU - at some point in the future if it doesnâ€™t reform itself to our satisfaction...? Leave the EU and stay in the single market, leave and stay in the customs union, leave and limit free movement or allow free movement, leave and adopt a Norway model, make a total break and go off the cliff into WTO trading.... There are 101 variations. â€œLeave the EUâ€ was virtually meaningless.""""The referendum result itself cannot be the â€œdecisionâ€.1.	It was not binding. 2.	There was no set threshold. 3.	The Supreme Court has confirmed that only Parliament can make such a decision, and by means of an Act of Parliament.When did Parliament make such a decision? The answer is - never. Parliament has never been asked to make a decision. It has passed no such Act.

If the number of foreign nurses applying to work for the NHS so precipitately in just one year then perhaps it does have specific rather than systematic causes.

I dare say that special treatment for non-British NHS workers might be an option. If the main problem is the plunge in the pound then that could be addressed in part by higher wages. If it looks like the UK and EU will reach a trade deal then that too should help the recovery of the pound.

20555,6,APB2710,"'So what are the significant differences between being in the EU Customs Union and being in a Customs Union with the EU?'I'm not knowledgeable enough to say in great detail but in essence the EU-Turkey is far more limited. And I can see that in three key ways:Firstly, agriculture is excluded from the EU-Turkey CU.Also, the EU-Turkey CU doesn't contain a common commercial policy, whilst the EU Customs Union does. So Turkey maintains an independent trade policy, though they Turkey was also required to 'align itself progressively with the preferential customs regime of the Community' (article 16 of the agreement, http://bit.ly/2sIibkw). And they are also affected by any new EU trade agreements signed, but without any voice in the negotiations themselves. Think CETA as a recent example. Which actually in turn has fed widespread Turkish dissatisfaction with the CU (http://bit.ly/2sgOgyz).VAT is also significantly different, though I lack the knowledge to explain how. But it won't be the same as how the EU VAT system was originally the main funding source for the old 'Common Market'.'Moreover, suppose we left the EU Customs Union but initially stayed in the Single Market and for that period had no new trade deals in effect'That's essentially the EFTA/EEA option, though the ideal situation would be to carry over the agreements with third countries. Whether you could call that a de facto customs union is an interesting way to put it. I'll add some more thoughts in edits when I get some sleep and think about it. However, it does occur to me that the EEA excludes Agriculture and Fisheries, so separate agreements on tariffs would be needed there in that scenario.Hope that answers your questions to some extent. I'm still trying to get my head around the many complexities that these issues throw up.Also, Monaco does technically stand as an example of an non-EU country in the EU Customs Union, as did East Germany I think before re-unification (very interestingly explored here http://bit.ly/2rLthR7).
