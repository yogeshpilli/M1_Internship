For the rest of the year I have to put up with restrictions, Treaty of Lisbon, TTIP, TAFTA, Ceta, Sanctions against Russia and central decision making that is highly influenced by well funded lobbies, instead of micromanagement influenced by we the people. I feel I have no say in where my tax money goes. It is not money well spent in the counterproductive subsidy system, the bailouts of banks and whole nations, the consequences of wars they helped to start and in the meantime they fuck up all my retirement money. The culprits of risky speculations and the Libor scandal get a slap on the wrist, but the middle class has to pay all the bills. In return we get a financial system that is worse than before we had the EURO, because it is unstable (financial crisis of 2007-), has higher inflation rates than the Deutsche Mark and has no other solution for influencing liquidity other then to cut my interest rates in my banking account. Sorry, but I feel quadruple-fucked and I can not enjoy all this freedom that is involved with us being in the EUSSR.",d4mti6e,d4mrkb8,4poopz,0.999975016,0.999950033,Brexit,25-06-16

Looking forward to your answer, a calm debate seems to be a rare opportunity.You use 3 arguments, but...1) if I understand your metaphor correctly, then having 1% of a smaller pie is still worse than 1% of a bigger pie.2) I just don't see the logical link between social media and why you should leave the EU? If anything, social media and ""buzz"" have been of great help to the leave camp, as they are great to convey simple and misleading ideas but not to explain the more complex and accurate and, yes, boring, ""expert"" point of view.3) well, yourself are saying that EU is the scapegoat.

3373,2,MuonManLaserJab,"Well, the same effect would probably show up in elections (i.e. the people who think they know the answer would be more likely to vote, and those that don't would stay home and thus defer to the others), but don't because the issues are politicized (i.e. the people who don't know the answer feel just as certain as, or more than, those who do). The real difference is that wrong answers on *Who Wants to be a Millionaire* don't have propoganda arguing for them. (The force of this propoganda is of course also bolstered by the ""bundling"" of ideas that makes people think along party lines even when their interests are split among both parties' platforms.)In any case, I don't think the *Men in Black* quote is appropriate here (or correct in general).

3380,2,aimtron,"No, that's just it. It's not the same effect at all. In my above mentioned scenario, the pooled wisdom is working towards a common goal. Individuals who do not know the answer benefit from deferring to those that either know the answer or know what is not the answer allowing a process of elimination. In an election, individuals don't defer, instead acting upon their own views per one or more issues that directly relate to them. The brexit is a good example. As I understand it, many voted because they take issue with immigration and have a fear that these immigrants will take their jobs. In the election scenario, they weren't working towards a common good, but instead focusing on what they think works in their immediate self-interest. Propaganda certainly played its role as well as you said, but overall, in elections, people tend to act more like individuals than they do crowds.",d4mu25k,d4mtn70,4pmh6k,0.0208806,-0.9582388,Against,25-06-16

Just not enough, and not the right ones.I don't think the ""common good"" thing is relevant. Chances are that one choice would have turned out to be best for almost everybody (i.e. whichever choice helps the economy most in the long run), in which case this isn't about selfishness but ignorance on the part of those who voted wrongly the other way.I think if you asked a *Millionaire* crowd an objective yet still political question (e.g. ""Do vaccines cause autism?"") you'd see the same thing as in the election: the ignorant do not defer, because they do not know that they are ignorant.",d4mudfp,d4mu25k,4pmh6k,0.619623033,0.239246067,Neutral,25-06-16

3542,2,Lumpy_Custard_,"There is a migrant crisis. It was caused when we armed some rebels to fight for us in the Iraq war. Those rebels are now called ISIS. We armed ISIS 10 years ago, we caused the instability in Syria. And now that people are fleeing that country in there millions, with Jordan having more refugees than native Jordinians, and we get 5000 refugees from a problem us and the USA caused and as a response we decide to leave the EU. Please educate yourself mate. Have a fucking heart for fucks sake, I like that you put ""refugees"" in quotation marks, as if half the fucking population of syria hasn't been displaced by fanatics.It's actually fucking disgusting to talk about innocent human beings the way you are right now. It's just salt in the wound that Britain is partly responsible for the situation.You vote in MEP's, you don't vote for experts proposing laws. In HM government, you vote for MP's but a group of unelected aristocrats in the house of lords (who inherit the position for life) get to block any laws they want if they fancy it. Which system is undemocratic again?Yeh that's whats wrong with our country! Too many regulations! Protecting the poor and the working class from shitty products that cause cancer and contain arsenic! We need less regulations like the USA. Who despite having more resources than us lead more unhappy, less fulfilling, fatter, shorter lives. Why do you hate regulations? They are in place to protect consumers, deregulation is good for companies because they don't have to give a shit about safety, the environment, sustainability, ethics. You read the Sun too much bro, Rupert Murdoch is in your head.I don't think businesses give a shit about regulations, they have them in other economies like Japan, I think they're more interested in the multi billion euro market, we are small fries compared to the rest of europe combined, they want access to the huge market, they already follow EU regulation to sell cars there anyway. Dumb comment.Competition is good for the user? Oh ok so we should privatise everything, NHS included? Are you THAT right wing? Would you prefer an american system, cus that works out so well for them.The EU will be fine as long as it's united, people have been saying it's going to fail for the past 10 years and fuck all has happened.Well the pound fell by enough to drop our economy behind frances, we are now the 6th largest, well done.It's not petty, old uneducated people made a decision for young people who have to live with it for 70 years. As if baby boomers haven't fucked over millenials enough. You hate bureaucracies, why? Is it because you've been told to by the sun, bureaucracies prevent corruption, crony capitalism, they provide a clear framework for things to be done around. The EU is probably the biggest bureaucracy on earth, and it has the best laws for protecting employees, all of them will evaporate now, expect more zero hour contracts, minimum wages not adjusting for inflation and generally expect the working classes to get fucked by this.Control of immigration, there it is, because once we stop Polish people coming in all our problems will be solved. Let me tell you this mate. If you were born english, and your job can be stolen by some Polak with no language, no skills, and no connections. Then you fucked up and should've worked harder in that World class Prussian style education we all got.Don't know where the fuck you think freedom is gonna come from. We're already in the top 10 countries in the Human freedom index http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/19/u-s-falls-to-20th-in-freedom-index/Other countries include Sweden denmark finland and ireland. You know, euro countries.Our leaders are corrupt as fuck, they are selling the NHS off to the highest bidder, they sold the Royal mail on the cheap to camerons mates.Why should we go it alone, what's wrong with being part of a bigger stronger union with europe?

3598,2,slickdickmcquick,"If I must explain it to you like you're five, let's back up a bit and first establish that BRexit stands for Britain (BR) to ""exit"" the European Union (EU) and those who want Bremain likewise want to ""remain.""  Now that we've got that covered, let's go over what the EU has done for the UK (or Britain).  The EU has placed taxation on the people of Britain that have NOT been approved by any British authority, the EU has place sanctions on Britain's trade and international borders that have set back their economy and industry substantially, the EU has poorly monitored the euro and therefore is destroying the British pound in the process, the EU annually demands a large sum of money from Britain to stay in power but at the same time accomplishes nothing of profit, the EU mandates that Britain accept millions of immigrants that continue to sexually assault women and molest children, not to mention they've also caused terrorist attacks on British soil and created ghettos that even the British police force cannot deal with, and as the EU does all of this to Britain -- meanwhile Britain's citizens can't even vote for who mandates these EU policies on their own nation.  Sound like a good deal yet?  In addition, UK citizens are also not allowed to speak out against the horrors of immigration because the Leftist controlled (and supporters of Bremain) British media will immediately label them a racist xenophobic bigot.  That's the best argument they've come up with thus far.  See how this is starting to resemble some of Trump's own policies of immigration?  So, now that Brexit has won and Bremain has lost, it's become a large symbol that the nonsensical policies of the Left are losing to the reasonable policies of the Right.  At this point, even a monkey can draw the correlation this has with Donald Trump (a Rightwinger who wants to place more strict controls on Muslim immigration) and Hillary Clinton (the Leftwinger nutjob who thinks that simply banning guns will solve the problem that over 90% of normal moderate Muslims believe all gays should be harshly punished -- even by death).Watch whenever Hillary or Barack speak, they never say the words ""Islamist extremists"" or ""radical Muslim"" terrorists.  They never say those exact words out of desire to please their over-sensitive special snowflake Leftist voters because the new minority group that Leftist voters want to protect now happens to be Muslims and anybody who says anything against Muslims will automatically be labeled by the Left as ""Islamophobic"".  Even despite the fact that they know full well Muslim societies inherently despise gays and severely oppress their women.  It's funny that Leftists want to protect the Islamic religion yet at the same time demonize Christianity yet at the same time all Leftists hate religion yet at the same time they love Feminism.  I don't know what's wrong with these people.  They're clearly diverting the whole problem to a different source than the actual culprit.  Imagine if a murderous guy killed a whole group of people with a chainsaw and instead of blaming the guy they just blamed the chainsaw.  This is why they're now being labeled as Regressives instead of Progressives because they're not going Forward anymore in terms of their political agendas, but completely Backwards.  All I will close with is this:  You do not have to believe anything at all that I just said, go ahead and find out the truth on your own.  I'm so confident in what I've just told you to be true that I don't even have to beg or force you to believe me.  You just have to be willing to discover it.  As opposed to what a normal Leftist would tell you:  ""Believe me or else you're just a racist xenophobic sexist bigot!""  Make your choice.   ",d4n4t8l,4ppz51,4ppz51,1,1,Brexit,25-06-16

Those that aren't eligible for free NHS treatment would be billed if they needed non emergency medical treatment, so instead they have a tendency to turn up at A&amp;E because they can get it free. This puts a massive strain on our emergency services, as does health tourism, people coming from abroad to get a free operation that they can't get for free in their own country. Then they leave without paying the bill. I personally have been waiting for a semi-urgent operation for a year now and am unable to work in the meantime. People's cancer drugs are having their funding cut off, surgeries that would enable children with cerebral palsy to walk, for example, are being refused, there aren't enough hospital beds or enough money to fund more, and an ever increasing population is only going to make things worse.Obviously the EU is not solely responsible for these problems and Brexit will not magically solve them, but if we can't control our borders our population is just going to keep increasing and so will overcrowding, because we have a very generous welfare system and migrants aren't stupid, they're going to head to the countries with the best prospects for their future.

3723,2,rawbdor,"The problem with phrasing the problem this way is that it presupposes the status-quo is a more acceptable option than leaving. As I mentioned in a different post, there exist problems where you may choose to act, or ignore, the problem. But there also exist problems that require action. Unfortunately, it usually requires a value judgement as to whether a given problem requires action or not.For example, passing an ammendment to a constitution is a proposition that pre-supposes the status-quo is extremely valid, and any changes to it must have overwhelming support.On the other hand, passing a normal law is one that pre-supposes the status quo may not be all rainbows and butterflies, and this law may be needed. So a simple majority is used. As an example, imagine some people walking down a country road. You decided as a group to walk straight for as long as you can. At a certain point, you approach an typical right-angle intersection. To the right looks very interesting, so you take a vote as to whether to change course. You had all previously decided to walk straight, so continue straight is the status quo. In this case you may require a supermajority to change direction, since any change would overrule the original steps you declared.Now take the similar example: the group of people walk forward and the road splits into two directly down the center. You must choose the left, or right fork. Going straight isn't really an option, because to go straight means you are leaving the road, and walking headfirst into trees, a cliff, or any other hinderances. Requiring a super-majority here may cause ""left"" to fail with a minority 47/53, and ""right"" to fail with a majority (but not super-majority) 53/47. This will result in you walking straight, a horrible decision.Obviously, it is a value judgement as to how you frame the issue. The question on UK membership in the EU can easily be framed in either perspective. It would seem logical to assume that since membership is currently given, any ""change"" should require a supermajority. However, it is also reasonable to frame the debate as a ""fork in the road"" where the public must either validate or reject the current path. The EU has changed greatly since UK joined it, and it could be argued nobody really quite knew what they were getting into long ago when joining.Forcing such a decision to have a supermajority to make a change assumes that the status quo is somehow more valid than a change. This is a dangerous assumption to make, because it may lead to nations marching in lockstep off a cliff like lemmings, simply because they were unable to achieve a supermajority to change direction.Finally, requiring a super-majority (as mentioned above) pre-supposes the status-quo is a more valid option, and any change requires overwhelming support. Think about what this means or sounds like to UK citizens:  our membership in a larger union is more important than what a simple majority of our people believe we should be doing, and we'll continue doing it unless overwhelming support tells us to stop.  This is a very easy way to lose legitimacy in the eyes of your people, basically telling them you know better. Just think of it as the UK ""group"" having walked straight with Europe, but, at some point, a sufficient number of UK members becoming tired or alarmed at the environment, have asked to turn around and go back home. Telling your group you require a super-majority to change course doesn't help...  if ""leave"" won 53/47 but didn't achieve a supermajority, the 53/47 outcome might result in you continuing to walk forward with Europe, but it denies you the legitimacy of your actions. Everyone will know you're walking forward, not because the majority thinks it's the right thing to do, but because the question was put to you in such a way as to minimize the effect of your vote.

3729,2,Ironaya,"I think one of the biggest issues is that the current political system (democracy) doesn't account for the effect any vote has on certain people. I am not saying democracy is bad but instead lets think about this:Should everyone have the same vote on something no matter if it affects them or not? Lets take climate change for example. People over the age of 50 are very unlikely to witness the full effects of it. Therefore they shouldn't be the ones leading the decisions and having an as big say as the people who will be affected by it.Lets look at the UK Vote now. The people who will have to live with this decision the longest are obviously the younger generations lets say people below the age of 50. What is characteristic for the Brexit vote is that it was an almost complete demographical vote. The ""old"" generation decided to leave (which you may or may not attribute to nationalist ideas) while the overwhelming majority of the younger generations voted to stay.I couldn't disagree more with the people who voted to leave. While we will obviously have to respect the UKs decision I think we will need to not ignore it but we also can't condemn the decision. You can't hold the other half of the population (the ""smarter"" one from my point of view) accountable for a decision they didn't support. That's why when the UK will inevitably want to get back into the EU we will need to support this movement. At some point in the future the old generation will have died out and the younger one which also teaches their children about the great value of the EU will have the chance to initiate another vote and probably win this one by a quite significant margin. For that time in the future we will need to think back and remember that those are the people that wanted to stay with us and therefore you should allow them to rejoin in an easy way.",d4ne83q,4przz2,4przz2,0.000181234,-0.999637532,Against,25-06-16

It's been frustrating to see the level of unexamined classist elitism from the supposedly enlightened progessive Londoners on my Facebook feed and in the media. There's a huge fallacy in thinking that anyone who voted out is just a stupid racist. In fact, it's a way of bypassing any debate around issues that make liberal people uncomfortable but deserve rational and open discussion (sovereignty, immigration, etc). Some Leave voters are racist, and the Leave campaign was very dirty, but associating everyone who voted Leave with a small group is what's known as a pre/trans fallacy and the result of low intelligence among the supposed intelligensia.  I'm 29, half Irish and half German, and have lived in London for 7 years - I'm about as 'European' as it gets, went to an international school and think multiculturalism is a positive force. At the same time, I think unfettered migration is problematic, particularly when it's being touted by an educated elite (of which I'm probably one) who have never had to compete for work with a migrant worker.Another point that might help someone understand why some people voted leave -  this was a referendum about membership to a deeply corrupt institution. The question on the ballot wasn't 'do you want less immigrants' or 'do you hate multiculturalism' - it was 'Should the UK leave the European Union.'   I ticked that box because I believe EU federalism is dangerous. I believe (like a few people have pointed out) that it has served its purpose and transformed into exactly the kind of force it was set up to prevent. I voted against the Lisbon treaty when I lived in Ireland, only to have the EU bully us into voting again 'until we got it right'. The way it's handled the Great Recession, the Greek crisis, the  corporate interests fuelling it, TTIP - the list goes on. I think the time has come for chaos and creativity, so that a new way of approaching politics can form based on self-determination, not alienation and disempowerment.

4247,2,traffickin,"Isn't Brexit essentially mitigating the damage from a number of growing problems? As someone who is bombarded heavily by American politics via the media (Hi, I'm Canadian) I am doing my best to put together the facts on the ground here. Swimming through the minimized version of ""Leave = racist, Remain = u dont no economies"" I am reaching the conclusion that many of the problems being brought up here were going to happen anyways?With under-performing countries relying on the economic strength of the manufacturing powers, the benefits of the trade policies stand to protect the general public. But with the grasp of international lawmaking the EU has an imbalance of political control, leading to (Belgium?) deciding policy for other countries, this sounds like a dangerous precedent as it makes the EU operate in a similar fashion to the USA's now overly powerful federal government. Or am I missing something there? Where do borders come into play; doesn't the EU essentially make European countries conjoined states with no independent autonomy? This seems like the EU is just attaching more and more weights to the ships that remain afloat, instead of sending ships to find land.**The Euro crash:** if Britain leaving causes some a dramatic effect on the currency, does that not expose what was essentially a huge imbalance in the source of that currency's value? If the UK was responsible for (if the drop was 1.58 USD to 1.09) essentially a third of the EU's worth, it seems like a very rational thing to leave as so much of your country's economy is tied to other people's wealth. I'm not an economist, just a normie looking for information here. The pound, euro, and American dollar approaching equilibrium also sounds like a huge boon to globalists, does that not create a more equal market internationally? I don't understand the difference between destabilizing the economy and a redistribution of wealth, which the same people who oppose brexit also call for.**Immigration policy:** as a Canadian, I've grown up my entire life in a haven for wartime refugees, as a kid in the early 90s, I had classmates from Kosovo and the Kuwait crisis, and have seen huge swaths of (specifically Sudanese and Somali) African refugees enter our country. Refugees are not a new thing, and Canada is a proud multicultural place, to the point where the majority of people I know are first or second generation immigrants. We're doing fine over here, but there is regulation, due process, and laws in place that prevent unregulated immigration. My wife is American, and while the Harper conservatives made it take longer than it should have, we were able to move her here without a hitch, it just took time. Is there any case in history for the benefits of unregulated immigration? The biggest case of unregulated immigration I can think of would be the colonizing of the Americas, which like the creation of the universe, has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move. What is the other side of this subject? Germany and Sweden have had a particularly public shitshow with their Syrian refugees, and from what I understand France has always had a problem with multicultural riots. When is it okay to say that the way the Syrian crisis has been handled poorly on the receiving end? Unregulated borders openly invites crime, the US/Mexico border, while patrolled by death squads on either side, can hardly be described as regulated. A huge amount of international crime relies on this instability and cannot operate with thorough regulations and due process of border control. The hardest part of this discussion is people's humanitarian pleas, as if security negates sympathy for the disenfranchised. The big argument here is that as one side is responsible for the struggles of the other, that we owe it to the affected bystanders to have unconditional access. That is strictly an emotional issue as there is no quantifiable way of helping the people that need it without the due process of border regulation. **TLDR** From the outside it seems like there are a lot of strong reasons for Brexit that are being ignored due to short term thinking. Many of the problems being addressed by it have been around for a long time, don't all countries have a responsibility to look after themselves before they can look after each other?

In recent years I have noticed an increasing xenophobia against Muslims. I myself am not Muslim but often still get some chav etc assuming I am because of the colour of my skin. Even when I gave birth at the RVI they assumed I wanted vegetarian meals despite me telling my midwife I could really do with a bacon butty after the birth. Now with this vote to Leave I feel that it might be time to move country. I strongly feel it's mainly about immigration and racism. My little one would be of mixed race but I don't want them potentially growing up in that type of society. My partner is very supportive and would like to move to Scotland or Ireland provided they go independent. I lived in Edinburgh when I was a student and although I loved it's beauty and culture I wouldn't have a clue about how to locate a family there.

4290,2,sjbeale,"Staying Positive After Brexit #BrexitSolutions#More young people have become politically active and engaged overnightA generation of disillusioned voters seems to have come alive and been awoken. Instantly, people are having political debates in a thought-provoking and emotionally charged ways that has not happened in my lifetime previously. Perhaps the closest thing to it Iâ€™ve seen was Britainâ€™s entrance to the war in Iraq, which although more directly severe in its consequences, divided people in the same way.The fact that so many young people, 75% in fact, voted to remain in the EU shows much promise for the future, even though reversing that vote might be very hard to do at the moment. The older generations emphatic leave vote has won but the future is not certain by any means. Especially since the leave campaign threw everything they had at it, extreme propaganda and all, and they still only limped over the finish line.#Social media has shown itself to be overwhelmingly progressive, and the old media is dyingGoing on Twitter the morning of the results, and searching for neutral hashtags like #EURefResults and #Brexit show them overwhelmingly defiant stance against the Brexit vote with the minority saying that it was a victory.Prior to this, I had often thought of social media commentary as being in line with bigoted and disgusting comments that I am accustomed to seeing on YouTube videos. However, Twitterâ€™s response yesterday morning was a breath of fresh air and reassuring to know that there were so many people out there searching for answers to this horrible mess that we find ourselves in.#Referendum results are not legally binding â€” protests and activism can still help to delay the processAlthough it may seem hard to believe, referendum results are not legally binding in the UK. Now I know it seems like this Brexit movement is progressing very fast, but there are potential solutions to stop it. For example, the UK government petition that has gained over a million signatures in 24 hours to trigger a second referendum given that they state the referendum cannot be taken seriously due to 74% turnout and only 52% of that voting to leave, way off a majority of the electorate.Some possible protest methods may be direct protest, just as those taking place in London as I write this. Others are joining progressive political parties or movements that you feel may be able to provide an alternative to Brexit. Workers in the UK can join trade unions who, although they were divided on Brexit, still offer solidarity and progressive ideas.Another option, which is less direct but more subversive, is to buy shares in all the newspapers that supported the leave campaign. For example, The Sun and The Times both owned coincidentally (!) by Rupert Murdoch. Now, before you say â€˜I do not want to give Rupert Murdoch any money!â€™, let me say that, by owning shares in these papers you have a right to attend meetings and and participate in votes. You can therefore disrupt and change the course of their dialogue. If enough people were to buy shares in these papers, they could soon be overrun with people who do not share the current views and ideology that they make so much money from. Shares in such papers are not as expensive as you think and can be bought with relative ease. Try it, it might just work. Iâ€™m going to look into after writing this!#Scotland will leave, breaking up the UK and hopefully forcing a new UK general electionWith Nicola Sturgeon stating that a second Scottish referendum on independence will happen in the near future, it looks increasingly likely that Scotland will vote to leave the UK.One of the great ironies of this being that David Cameron, who campaigned hard for Scotland to remain part of the UK, used the fear mongering tactic of saying that Scotland would not be able to join the EU if it were to become independent. Now, the same Scottish voters have woken up to a country that has 100% voted to stay in the EU, but with their neighbours dragging them out of it against their will. The United Kingdom seems to be coming to an end, or at least the very opposite of united.With Scotland leaving the United Kingdom, this will first throw the current Parliament into chaos given the amount of seats for members of Parliament representing Scotland. This should in turn trigger a new general election given that it will be impossible to say that the previous government is representative of the country in the wake of likely Scottish independence.#David Cameronâ€™s middle-of-the-road nothing politics are no more â€” the divide is real and people now have 2 distinct options to choose fromAlthough I never voted for David Cameron, I didnâ€™t particularly despise him either. Much of his politics was based on middle-ground policies, pleasing as many people as possible style tactics that have been the norm in the UK for the last two decades.Now with the power vacuum that he has left after giving his resignation, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove look set to run the Conservative Party, both of whom make Cameron look like a peaceful moderate given their further right-wing views and worrying rhetoric.In light of this, political battle lines have been drawn for the next generation or more. No longer will there be a mild and centre right Conservative Party â€” this is a win for the right wing and it leaves Labour and other opposition parties little choice but to come out and defend the other side of the political spectrum providing a real alternative, rather than pandering to centrist voters with populist politics.Equally culpable are the Labour Party of the last two decades, starting with Tony Blairâ€™s New Labour project, culminating in Gordon Brownâ€™s weak run as Prime Minister. Jeremy Corbyn appears to be a man with good ideas but also portrayed in an extremely negative light by the media, mostly about trivial issues that will not affect his ability to run the country. As such, he provides a real alternative to the neo-con elites who are smiling post-Brexit.www.stephenbeale.me",NA,NA,4ps7f6,2.59E-14,-1,Against,25-06-16

4423,2,FeeltheBernBaby16,"The dirty secret you need to know.I work for a marketing agency, and one of the areas that we specialise in is politics. If you somehow donâ€™t know, it is now possible to create terrifyingly complete profiles of users and our company sells those to political groups for election and issue research.        We watched the build up to the Brexit vote and created vast, detailed assortments of profiles for both sides.  As part of that, we got to know the people of the UK well as we collected all of this data.  Here is what we found: 1. Computers and internet access, in general, run conversely to age, (i.e.-the older the citizen, the less likely they have their own).2. In closed monitoring (general data collection gathered through search engines), we found that, despite the above fact that the older the citizen the less likely they are to own a computer or have internet access, there was a direct proportion to time spent researching Brexit. Even though 18-24 had the greatest access to personal computers and the internet, they actually spent the least amount of time researching it.On terminals belonging to those 18-24, an average of 37 minutes was observed relating to Brexit research.  On terminals belonging to those 55+, an average of 691 minutes was observed conducting research related to the Brexit.3. We conducted online surveys to this point, and the results were horrifying.  The survey was a selected cross-sample and each participant volunteered their answers (survey conducted day of voting).88% of those 18-24 admitted that they spent less than one hour researching the Brexit.  19% admitted to spending less than 10 minutes. 10 minutes!81% of those 24-29 admitted they spent less than an hour.77% of those 30-35% acknowledged that they spent less than an hour.Conversely, not one single respondent aged 65 or higher spent less than 30 minutes.On average, they spent an impressive 18 hours researching, 11% spent more than 20 hours.  In contrast, not even a single respondent in the 18-24 age group said they spent this much time researching.  The 65+ age group went to libraries, used community computers, and arranged to use family member's computers, and they invested amazing amounts of time leading up to the vote.4.  Here's the dirty secret (and what is so infuriating) we sold this data to several Remain groups, we briefed them on the surprisingly little research being done by those in the lower age brackets, and we told them of the disparate averages among older voters.  In response, they literally crafted a message to cover this up.  At the heart of their messaging, was  that ""only stupid people vote Leave.""  From the celebrities they rolled out, to the ads, the undertone was the same, if you are smart and sophisticated, you will vote to stay.  They determined that their supporters were not concerned with the facts and they created a campaign that appealed to vanity.  If you have ever used the response that the Leave voters are stupid, you are not some creative genius, you are a mindless wanker regurgitating a line crafted by a soulless bureaucrat who thought you would be gullible enough to say if for them for free.  Congrats on proving them correct.5. As a result, here's the part that no one is talking about now.  Much has been made of the fact that Google trends revealed that there was a surge in searches related to the EU and what it means to leave, etc.  What no one is saying is WHO is doing the searches.  The reality is, we have profiles for each I.P. address (whether they are likely a Leave or Remain voter).  9/10 people who searched  ""What is the EU?"" and ""What does it mean to leave the EU"" did so from a terminal identified as a Remain supporter (68% of those after-the-vote searches were conducted on devices owned by someone under 24).  They were so confident that the UK would vote to Remain, that they never seriously researched what a Leave vote would even mean.On average, terminals identified to be owned by a Leave supporter did about five hours of research, while the average Remain supporter researched just 44 minutes.   We have some pretty mean NDAs in place, so I cannot disclose anything beyond this.  The factual reality is the older population made far more of an effort and spent considerably more time researching than the average younger voter.",d4o1nhs,4psqm5,4psqm5,7.89E-14,-1,Against,26-06-16

I just read news articles about it.I find it very difficult to believe not one 18-24 year old respondant did more than an hour of research? Being as 1/3 of young people go to university, and knowing my peers, we discussed brexit, watched the news and question time and shared articles on brexit.I really feel like you are making this up. Also, 9/10 of the people asking what brexit was were remain supporters?

The NHS is overburdened, it's also being chronically underfunded by the conservatives, what do you think the junior doctor protests have been about? The reason the conservatives are purposefully underfunding the NHS is because when it inevitabley fails or breaks they can say 'it clearly isn't working under government control, only private companies can handle the increased requirements of a modern health service'.The NHS is actually propped up by immigrants, there is a higher percentage of immigrant and immigrant descent doctors and nurses working in the NHS than the percentage of the population they make up. They are also often young, and more likely to be male, therefore need very little care by the NHS. Thirdly, the average immigrant actually contributes more in tax money than the average white working class person than they take away, so they support the tax system which supports the NHS. Lastly, the population bulge of baby boomers are reaching retirement so we need an influx of young immigrants to support the inevitable increase in cost of the NHS.The housing crisis in London is caused by the worlds wealthy buying holiday homes in the centre as a status symbol and only living in them for a few weeks a year.The national housing crisis has been caused by people not dying as fast as expected due to our excellent and free health services, economic migrants often live in crowded conditions (the student house I'm moving out of was going to be leased to contracters who would ship over 6 Polish workers to live in our student house, it's a really shitty house and I'd never want to live there permenantly), whereas older people often live alone in their old family home. So really immigrants contribute to the economy and take up the least space per capita of all of us.I understand there are problems, and if I was working class I'd be scared that my job could be taken by a semi skilled Polish worker. But these are sacrifices the country has to make.I also totally understand the fear that our culture is being diluted, I'm from Leicester which is less than 50% white British now, it doesn't really bother me and its always weird going to Uni where everyone is white. The thing is, white people just aren't reproducing enough, on average we have something like 2.1 babies per couple, so we are barely replacing ourselves. In an economic sense, we need population growth, and the migrants growth is positive in that sense. In a cultural sense, yes, I understand peoples fears that white British people and values might not exist in 50 years.

4622,2,Zinegata,"Correlation is not equal to causation. Making sweeping generalizations of intelligence based on the number of minutes spent ""researching"" an issue demonstrates that you have absolutely no business being a marketing professional, if you really are one. You can study for your entire life and _still_ end up a moron, because study is not a function of _time spent_ but on a variety of other factors - like efficiency of methodology and general approach to new information; both of which are areas where the older generation are distinctly bad at. More specifically, doing 18 hours of research on Brexit does _not_ make you better-informed about it. An equally compelling argument can be made that people who studied an issue for 18 hours is just intellectually circle-jerking. There has never been any study that shows length of study leads to wiser decisions. Indeed, in most studies people are distressingly inclined towards pre-conceived notions _regardless_ of the facts that are presented to them; and only a portion of the population (skewed towards the young) are really malleable when it comes to their opinions.Don't believe me? Then how many of those pro-Leave supporters are aware that the vast majority of ""Islamic Terrorist attacks"" are targeted towards _Muslims_? Why are these Leave people so afraid of Islamic ""terrorists"" when there are so few attacks in the West, as opposed to weekly (or even more frequent) attacks against Muslims in Iraq, Syria, Libya, or Pakistan?I'd bet most of your respondents, despite spending ""so much time on research"", never stumbled on these simple realities about the world and instead just repeated to themselves that immigration brings in terrorists.The only _certain_ conclusion we can make is that the said person had _time to spare_ to do research. This is entirely unsurprisingly  as every study on Millennials have show, they do _not_ have a lot of spare time because their parents are too busy relying on them to pay for the health care and retirement. This is the entire reason why Millennials are reliant on web-based research - which tends to be quite fast and less time-consuming - rather than spending 18 hours poring over a newspaper (and most likely just an op-ed column at that) to confirm their preconceived notions.In short, the Leave people are not any smarter just because they spent more time on research. That in fact can mean they are less efficient at research, and it certainly supports all other research showing that the older people in the West by and large have too much time on their hands (to the point they waste 18 hours on a rather simple issue) and are letting the younger generation pick up the tab. (Edit: Noted the study limitations on the Brexit age patterns)The real simple generalized reality of Brexit's age issue - taking into consideration that voting blocks are not entirely united - is that the older generation wanted to leave; because of the mistaken idea that globalization is something to fear and leads to terrorism. The younger generation, which every study has shown is much more accepting and internationalized, did _not_ want to leave. They understood that there are no real differences between kids in the UK, France, or Germany. Because the Internet allowed them to experience being friends with people in other countries and hence they are not afraid of them.This is why the young are pissed off. And that's why you will see a pretty big anti-Brexit backlash; probably starting with Scottish independence.",d4oc8cj,4pv16g,4pv16g,1.65E-08,-0.999999967,Against,26-06-16

4631,2,Zinegata,"Your conclusions were wrong to begin with, so how can they have mishandled the data? The Leave people were not more intelligent because they spent more time on research. Telling Leave people they were being _really stupid_ isn't blindly repeating a marketing mantra: It's nothing less than the simple truth. Circle-jerking over an issue does not make you better-informed about it. The problem with the Leave crowd, as with the vast majority of people making stupid decisions, is that they would rather burn the world down rather than admit that they are making a mistake. No campaign would make them change their minds. The crucial issue instead was how to motivate the Remain crowd.Because based on the data, you _can_ say is that the ""time on research stat"" is an _indicator_ of the level of _commitment_ both sides had to their campaign. The Leavers had time on their hands and really wanted to Leave which is why they spent so much time on it. The Remain folks... didn't, because they didn't see the point. Other studies support this general conclusion.So the question is _not_ about how to avoid hurting the feelings of the stupid Brexiters. They will push for Brexit regardless. The question is how to motivate the Remain base to the same level as the Brexiters. If anything, just calling the Leavers stupid was not going far enough; the government should have simply said outright that they were trying to take away the future of the younger generation _because_ they are a dying and wasteful generation. And guess what, that's the story that's emerging _now_, after the Brexiters ""won"". Because all of the previously uninvolved ""Remain"" folks have just realized what was taken from them. That's the problem with small vocal minorities trying to railroad the rest of the nation. At some point they just end up creating even bigger vocal minorities who want the opposite.In short, as with the ""Trump phenomenon"", the answer to an obnoxious position with a very motivated (but limited) base isn't to _pander_ to the said idiotic base. They don't want to listen to begin with. They will _never_ listen to you to begin with. You win by motivating your own base by pointing out these idiots are about to take away things important to you. The failure to motivate the base is why Remain fell short, and why Cameron justifiably fell on his own sword. ",d4ocqv0,d4obawi,4pv16g,0.000139076,-0.999721848,Against,26-06-16

What Marius did was effectively decouple the army from the state by allowing non landed people to serve. This effectively made the armies loyal to the general rather than the state and within 50 years Rome was ruled by absolutist tyrants.If the EU army came to be what is stopping a Eurocrat from usurping control of the EU army in say for example Romania by bribing them and becoming the next Augustus Caesar?",d4ocspt,d4oaup6,4pv16g,0.999999695,0.99999939,Brexit,26-06-16

Well for the people secrecy is a democratic factor, I hope that when you voted you could prepare your ballot in secrecy.Then which president? The president of the parliament? Elected. And broadcasted on Euronews the last time.Then for the appointed. There lies the problem that many people didnt understand. The EU is a union of States, through their governing bodies, where the decision process is in the hands of the governing bodies of each member States.The European Council is directly made of Heads of States/Government of the members. They have the real power and the decision making. They appoint the president of the European Council that is the permanent position that doesnt represent the people but the members of the council and whose task is to make the liaison between its members to find a concensus as all decisions are concensual (that means that all taken decision taken has to be approves by each state, UK included) and the other european bodies.The president of the Commission is proposed by this council but elected by the parliament then he/she proposes a list to man the commission and each candidate are reviewed by the parliament. By the way, the last time it was broadcasted on Euronews.So where is the secret? Is it a good system? It could certainly be better. Do you want to vote to choose a president, the permanent position and give him a mandate? Fine but in this case even deeper integration is needed and basicly it would mean to have a presidential system with a real supranational body that would turn the EU into a *de facto* confederation with more power.Rejecting the so called ""un-democractic"" can be understood but honestly most of the arguments told during the campaign were mere BS. Honestly numerous teenagers were more prepared to vote because they have at least studied the EU at school, and numerous adults did not even know what they were talking about.

4974,2,MoLoLu,"The problem is, the 'ballslessness' of this maneuver is the predominant perception outside of the UK.I'm not terribly pro or against the EU (it has good and bad sides) and obviously not from the UK, so I only have an outsider's perspective, but voting for a course of action devoid of any plan of action seems odd to me any everyone I've talked to. All this turmoil that's being caused is mostly because there was no concrete exit plan, not even a proposed timetable â€“ nothing, just an idea. The longer this drags on, and it seems it will for months at least, the more credibility the UK will loose as a sovereign state capable of independent decision making.The state of the UK just days after this decision isn't exactly inspiring confidence in this whole ""UK going her own way"" thing. I was kind of expecting celebration and rapid steps toward making Britain Great again. Instead, the PM stepped down, London is pissed off, Scotland wants another referendum, and UKIP admitted they actually don't know how to Brexit either. So, to us looking in from the outside, it feels like you shot yourself in the foot and broke the UK, which is completely the opposite of what the Exit campaign promised.Ironically, in a once in a lifetime event, the EU put out a fairly clear ultimatum, stating it wants the UK to leave quickly and taking steps to ensure the rest of the Union is ready. Rather than capitalize on this win, the UK is dangling in indecision rather than acting boldly. This could have been a swift, clean break that demonstrated the EU's flaws and UK's determination, setting the stage for EU reform or a move for EU-independence across Europe.If recent news is any indication however, it's backfired and now the UK is in a terrible bargaining position both internally and externally, with no tangible gain in sight. They can't back out of Brexit without civil unrest, and they can't go forward with it because they don't know how to actually do that. But delaying Article 50 will cause unrest too, and now they have the EU breathing down their necks on top of everything else. Worse, any delays and indecision on behalf of the UK strengthens the EU's position, as it was the UK's decision to Brexit. The EU gains for every day the UK Govt tries to sort itself out, and the longer this goes on, the more pressure Brussels can put on the UK. If the break actually comes, and there's really no way to know whether that will happen, it will probably be at hugely disadvantageous or disastrous terms for the UK. The rest of the EU will be prepared.There was a huge potential to apply political pressure to the EU through Brexit; huge potential to be the shining example the rest of Europe would look up to and follow. It was wasted due to poor (nonexistent?) planning. Now the whole ordeal is setting a terrible example for other countries that may want to leave the EU for whatever reason. It's also pulled back the curtain on just how messy and convoluted UK political maneuvering is â€“ and this while the whole world watched, on national TV to boot! This whole thing couldn't have gone any worse for the UK if it had been designed to.Given, there's a slim chance Article 50 can be delayed until the rest of the EU is thrown into turmoil again, but the question is: can the UK really delay that long? It doesn't seem like delaying tactics will be well received. The UK's in for a rough time to say the least.",d4omynl,d4ogt70,4pw2fa,0.318740995,-0.36251801,Against,26-06-16

5051,2,RAndrewOhge,"Sanders: British Voted Against The Way World Economy Is WorkingBy S.A. Miller - Jun 25, 2016Democratic presidential contender Sen. Bernard Sanders said Friday that the British vote to exit the European Union showed that the â€œglobal economy isnâ€™t working for everybody.â€[http://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/bernie-sanders/]Mr. Sanders, who finished the primary race behind likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but has yet to end his campaign, said that as an American he would not judge the U.K. vote, which shocked the world and rattled markets.â€œWhat worries me very much is the breaking down of international cooperation. Europe in the 20th century, as we all know, the kind of blood that was shed there was unimaginable. You never want to see that again,â€ Mr. Sanders said on MSNBCâ€™s â€œMorning Joeâ€ program.Still, in the historic Brexit vote, he heard echoes of his campaign that railed against income inequality.â€œOn the other hand, what I think this vote is about is an indication that the global economy is not working for everybody,â€ he said. â€œYou know, itâ€™s not working in the United States for everybody, and itâ€™s not working in the U.K. for everybody.â€â€œPeople are saying, â€˜You know what, the global [economy] may be great for some people but not for me,â€™ â€ Mr. Sanders said.http://www.defenddemocracy.press/sanders-british-voted-way-world-economy-working/",d4oq57r,4pyftk,4pyftk,0.000194492,-0.999611017,Against,26-06-16

5055,2,Lumpy_Custard_,"Yeh article 50 is very interesting, none of the Brexit leaders are very keen to step forward and actually initiate the Brexit. Did you see the twitter post that's been going viral? Here it is, so interesting, I didn't even know any of this was happening and really recommend reading it if you haven't already:If Boris Johnson looked downbeat yesterday, that is because he realises that he has lost.Perhaps many Brexiters do not realise it yet, but they have actually lost, and it is all down to one man: David Cameron.With one fell swoop yesterday at 9:15 am, Cameron effectively annulled the referendum result, and simultaneously destroyed the political careers of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and leading Brexiters who cost him so much anguish, not to mention his premiership.How?Throughout the campaign, Cameron had repeatedly said that a vote for leave would lead to triggering Article 50 straight away. Whether implicitly or explicitly, the image was clear: he would be giving that notice under Article 50 the morning after a vote to leave. Whether that was scaremongering or not is a bit moot now but, in the midst of the sentimental nautical references of his speech yesterday, he quietly abandoned that position and handed the responsibility over to his successor.And as the day wore on, the enormity of that step started to sink in: the markets, Sterling, Scotland, the Irish border, the Gibraltar border, the frontier at Calais, the need to continue compliance with all EU regulations for a free market, re-issuing passports, Brits abroad, EU citizens in Britain, the mountain of legistlation to be torn up and rewritten ... the list grew and grew.The referendum result is not binding. It is advisory. Parliament is not bound to commit itself in that same direction.The Conservative party election that Cameron triggered will now have one question looming over it: will you, if elected as party leader, trigger the notice under Article 50?Who will want to have the responsibility of all those ramifications and consequences on his/her head and shoulders?Boris Johnson knew this yesterday, when he emerged subdued from his home and was even more subdued at the press conference. He has been out-maneouvered and check-mated.If he runs for leadership of the party, and then fails to follow through on triggering Article 50, then he is finished. If he does not run and effectively abandons the field, then he is finished. If he runs, wins and pulls the UK out of the EU, then it will all be over - Scotland will break away, there will be upheaval in Ireland, a recession ... broken trade agreements. Then he is also finished. Boris Johnson knows all of this. When he acts like the dumb blond it is just that: an act.The Brexit leaders now have a result that they cannot use. For them, leadership of the Tory party has become a poison chalice.When Boris Johnson said there was no need to trigger Article 50 straight away, what he really meant to say was ""never"". When Michael Gove went on and on about ""informal negotiations"" ... why? why not the formal ones straight away? ... he also meant not triggering the formal departure. They both know what a formal demarche would mean: an irreversible step that neither of them is prepared to take.All that remains is for someone to have the guts to stand up and say that Brexit is unachievable in reality without an enormous amount of pain and destruction, that cannot be borne. And David Cameron has put the onus of making that statement on the heads of the people who led the Brexit campaign.",d4oqdqt,d4op95g,4pxb8j,5.99E-15,-1,Against,26-06-16

5057,2,MoLoLu,"I'd like to clarify a few things from the Swiss perspective. For reference, I'm a left-tending mind with certain moderate and right ideas, especially around economics. I'm also an immigrant who's lived in CH all my life.- the 'migrant crisis' was overblown by the media, though north african immigration was a problem and still is. Despite closed borders. So closing the borders was a good decision IMO but it's a bit of a political cop out because we can't actually keep out the major issues. The biggest problem today is crime tourism from EU countries (including refugees who get deported back) which we can't shut out for a number of reasons and don't have the police force to handle. It's criminally understaffed to the point of inefficiency; I've witnessed this first hand and it's alarming. So closing the borders is all good and well, but it really doesn't solve any of the problems, and we still get more or less the same number of legit asylum applicants under our own laws â€“ we throw out economic migrants, but that's not making a significant difference when 25% of our population is imigrants from mostly EU countries (as an US citizen, I'm a tiny minority of the minority).- Switzerland's economy is a terribly unstable mess that's tied so closely to the EU we might as well be part of it. We, quite literally, can't do anything without Brussels putting political pressure on us in some way or our Franc going gaining value to the point that it's easier to live outside of Switzerland than in it. We tried to maintain a bunch of systems that got steam rolled by international politics so badly it's not even funny (financial sector and industrial production got shafted repeatedly over the past 8 years). We are clinging desperately to our independence while hoping the EU market doesn't scramble in crisis again, becaue if it does, our economy will go down the drain along with the rest of Europe, paradoxically because it's â€žtoo stableâ€œ. Net result is we're a nonconforming dependant in all the wrong ways.- despite being a fairly xenophobic and isolated country, Switzerland is hopelessly dependant on international trade, particularly in the service and pharma industries. We're all more or less clear on the EU being a bad thing but we're... stuck. No one wants in, and no one can really do anything about the Union, and we need expats to continue functioning. Unless the EU fails completely â€“ the best scenario for Switzerland IMO â€“ we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. Sure, we're a sovreign nation, and well off at that with intact social systems, but we have about as much political freedom as Greece when it comes to actually changing anything that might affect the EU. And we can't even decide within our borders, because someone always has something to say; there's always a risk we'll anger the EU (in particular Germany) and get something beneficial canceled for unrelated reasons.This whole EU thing is a disaster in my mind. But it's a disaster regardless of whether you're in or out, mostly because it became more than just an economic union. I'm very worried that an UK outside the EU will learn, as Switzerland had to, how alone they really are when it comes to dealing with EU and international affairs â€“ and how hopelessly dependant they are on other continental economies to maintain any semblance of stability.We had a few votes earlier this year about distancing ourselves form the EU and it caused a major outcry. For years, we'd moved away from the EU. But this year it went too far â€“ virtually everyone rallied against these increasingly xenophobic referendums (Volksinitativen) because they would have risked alienating the EU and plunging us into a recession, as well as making us uncompetitive with the rest of Europe. The precedent here was historically unheard of. All but the most extreme nationalistic party rallied against this move. We've never been this united on an issue before and we're united in this for all the WRONG reasons.I can't see an easy way out of this mess that doesn't end in disaster or Switzerland capitulating to the EU. It's a bit scary to be honest. Not for me, becaue I'm a foreigner and can always 'go back home' if things go too sour. But it's a major issue for the Swiss, who are forced to live in this increasing uncertainty. Many people â€“ and not just young people my age â€“ are worried about whether the country will survive the next decade and remain the 'nice place' we know. There's increasing fear our economy will keep doing too well (though people don't recognize it as that) and we'll be left behind, scraping by with a dwindling job market as oppertunistic companies move elsewhere.Neither the left nor the right has a solution that seems to work. And we're acutely aware of how powerless we are.",d4oqfyw,d4ntbqx,4psx1u,0.015275154,-0.969449692,Against,26-06-16

5061,2,RAndrewOhge,"Fukuyama, an ex-official of the State Department, with very poor intellectual capacities, became world famous in 1990 with his idea that History has ended. Now History is back, in full steam.One may agree or disagree with Brexit. But he has to admit that here we have to do with a clear anti-establishment revolt of the British, a revolt with clearly national but also clear class characteristics. Look for instance the pattern of the vote. City voted overwhelmingly to remain in the Union, the popular, de-industrialized and agricultural regions of the country, the â€œlost of globalizationâ€, very much for Brexit. (As has happened in many cases, during the collapse of the Soviet Union, nationalism was not the only direct reason of the quest for independence of the Republics, antagonisms for power and property were very much the reason, still it was the national idea which offered a ready basis of legitimacy for the break down).The result represents also an enormous historic defeat for Dr. Scheuble and the whole German leadership, it understands or not (as so many times has happened in German history).The question is not Britain, the question concerns all EuropeIt is not only that Britain is exiting the EU. The Union itself has entered a process of a probable collapse as a structure. This process will leave nothing unaffected. Internal equilibriums in various national states, the European economic order and geopolitics. It is not only the neoliberal (under German co-domination) EU which will probably leave the scene of history. It is all the European â€œancien regimeâ€ which is prepared to leave. At least the one consecrated with the adoption of the Maastrich Treaty and the triumph of neoliberalism. (Indirectly also with the political choice to go on with NATO enlargement, of which the EU enlargement was the political-economic part).Let us hope that the collapse of post-national neoliberalism will not lead also to the collapse of the fundamental achievements of European peoples after 1945. From now on we enter a â€œchaoticâ€ period, in the mathematical sense of the word, with very different positive or negative possibilities.An Unacceptable UnionThey will do and say everything to reinterpret, to diminish and to distort the meaning of the British vote, still the verdict is unequivocal and its significance explosive.The European Union, at least as it stands now and with the policies and the arrogance it is producing, is simply unacceptable not just by British, but by a clear majority of all European citizens. The Maastricht system, institutional incarnation of neoliberalism (and Atlanticism), imposed in Western Europe in the wake, and under the enormous impact of the collapse of â€œSoviet socialismâ€, and also of the Mitterrand (and the British Left) defeat and capitulation and of the German reunification, as it was executed, proved to be a socially regressive, economically inefficient, politically oligarchic, antidemocratic structure.It is collapsing in front of our eyes, as the result of the first wave (2008) of the financial crisis and the way European leaders reacted to it. Its destruction could catalyze a second wave of financial-economic crisis.The final political blow to the legitimacy of the European Union was inflicted last year, when all the world saw the way Berlin and Brussels crashed Greece, a member of the European Union.Even if they did not say anything at the time, everybody drew the conclusions about the nature and the character of this Union and of German policy in Europe. It was only a question of time before the political fall-out of this â€œvictoryâ€ turns back, hitting those who masterminded it. This is what is happening now.Greeks were too weak to succeed in their rebellion. British were too strong to accept such a Union. It was History, not the Left or the Right, which put European revolt on the order of the day. European Left proved in 2015 too hesitating, too weak, too unwilling to become the leader of the Revolt till the end. A part of the European Right was there to fill the vacuum, at least at that stage. And it did it.By voting to leave the European Union, British citizens confirmed, as contradictory as it may seem, that they are deeply Europeans, in their own way of course and following the particular path history and the international position of their country has determined.By voting the way they voted, British did the same that did, before them, the citizens of Cyprus, of France, of Netherlands, of Ireland, of Greece, every time they had the opportunity. They rejected massively the policies produced and imposed by the elites, both national and European ones (the two more and more indistinguishable), in spite of the enormous terror and propaganda campaigns to do the opposite.European elites answered to this repeated cry of peoples by saying to them that they donâ€™t understand what they are voting for, by ignoring the direct expression of the popular will and by doing the exact opposite of the policy they were mandated by their electorate to apply, in complete disrespect of the most elementary democratic principles.The Marie Antoinette SyndromeMaybe European elites thought that, if there is divorce between people and its rulers, they should change people, as once Berdold Brecht put it to the address of the rather deaf East German rulers of his time.By doing it time and again, they simply laid the ground for a strong European nation to go one step further than previous revolts, voting clearly for a divorce with Brussels. Though some forces in the British Left have supported this, so it would be inexact to attribute everything to the Right (the opposite happened in Greece where a part of the Right supported the revolt), it did that under the initiative and the domination of Rightist forces, because they were the only available to play this role. This may have and it will have of course a huge impact on the follow-up, but is not changing the fundamentals roots and the character of the revolt. It makes more, not less necessary for the European Left to review and change in a radical way its policy towards both the national and the European questions. If it will not do it, it will simply disappear just as the regime is disappearing.In Britain, but also everywhere in the continent, the European Union is more and more understood by a majority of the citizens as a system not defending people from, but organizing social regression. (Some of its leaders even say it openly, probably unaware of the political consequences. Barroso for instance said some years ago that everybody knows that future generations will live in worse conditions than in the past! Some advisors of Sarkozy have stated openly their goal to overrun completely the social project incarnated in the historic compromise French communist resistance passed with De Gaulle, in exchange for resigning from the goal of a revolution in France, but also because De Gaulle supported in fact a â€œsocial-democraticâ€ and national project for his country).In the western and in the southern parts of Europe â€œEuropean integrationâ€ as it is realized, it is also more and more understood as a mechanism to take back from people the political freedoms and rights they used to enjoy after the victory over Nazism and Fascism, in 1945 and, as far as it concerns Portugal, Spain and Greece, after the collapse of the dictatorships in 1974. It is not a coincidence the fact that JP Morgan for instance, published, some years ago, a report stating that the huge obstacle to reform which needs to be overcome are the â€œantifascist constitutionsâ€ South European nations acquired after 1974!It is important to remark at this point that there is from time to time a lot of talk of â€œfederationâ€ in Europe, but no real project of federation. By â€œfederationâ€ they mean, in really Orwellian terms, not any federation of European nations and states. They mean their subordination to the power of the High International Finance (and the US as far as it concerns geopolitical questions). There is no more telling symbol of this subordination, and of the enormous lie hidden behind all federation talk, than the appointment of a Goldman Sachs banker, Mr. Mario Dragui, in the position of the President of the (independent, but only from people and nations) European Central Bank, in fact to the position of an unelected European super Prime Minister.The revolt of Europeans is developing along national lines for a number of reasons. Most people, especially the most threatened, and in particular the more traditional working class, feel the need, by instinct, before they hear anybody telling them, of state and of nation to protect them...http://www.defenddemocracy.press/end-regime-europe/",d4oqlwu,4pyhwe,4pyhwe,0.999999998,0.999999996,Brexit,26-06-16

The eu can't fix Greece because Greece's problems stem from culture or more precisely the way Greeks use and conceive of money in an island culture.The trouble is that while Greece is going to implode at some point, and be forced to find its own way forward, the never-ending wave of refugees are not all actual refugees- there are sleeper jihadists among them who are going to unleash hell across Southern Europe in the coming few years.Their purpose is to further erode civilization. I don't see any way to undo the salt that has been sown in Southern Europe other than saying NO MORE IMMIGRANTS.

5091,2,MoLoLu,"The issue for Greece (and s. Europe) is more or less a geographical one. Syria, Turkey, and the N. African countries are way too close and they have too many territories to effectively close off. All the islands and porous borders are... difficult to control. This is much easier on continental Europe where there's no huge, open sea offering untold possibilities. The Greeks would have to follow a concentration camp style plan, which is more or less what the latest Greek plan is: move people into government camps run by the military. Just without execution chambers. The problem is no one knows what happens to all those people next. They promise asylum. That'll backfire once those many people realize they'll never reach European utopias, and probably not live outside a camp for a decade at least.My point is (though I may be politically left, I'm sane enough to realize solidarity is no solution) that the only way to solve it is to physically detain and push back waves of extremely desperate people in ways that even many conservatives would consider inhumane. These folk have nothing to loose and will keep trying. Short of posting armed guards with loaded magazines, and creating a few corpses as an example, nothing will change.Having spoken to quite a number of Syrians, most of whom have given up Nationalism (many were pro-Syria but in the chaos of losing half their families, getting shot, and blown out of houses, they've kinda given up hope in winning back their homeland without western support), the chances anyone will go back home willingly are... slim to nonexistent unless they are forced, physically and viscerally, to accept that Europe isn't even remotely a better option. Tear gas, rubber bullets, and the occasional beating are still better than a high likelihood of death, execution, and torture.The cluster fuck being caused here is mostly due to people's inability to be hard, cold, and heartless when geopolitics demands thus. The Greeks are IMO quite nice people, suffering from their own economic troubles, but you're right. They have to take a really hard line and fast if they want to recover even a little. Shut everyone new out, deal with the current situation, and then stop it from happening again. But that's virtually impossible in practice because no one wants to be the one to make the call, and so the chaos will continue.Doesn't even take jihadists â€“ to my knowledge I spoke to no fundamentalists during my time. If this continues for a few months, they'll turn radical simply to find a 'purpose' in life â€“ or maybe just to do more than sit on their hands all day, waiting for somethign to happen that never will. This could have been avoided in so many ways. Like closing borders before this became a problem. But it's too late for that. I'm convinced there will be a disaster that will be felt all across Europe, and probably sooner than most people think.",d4osmkz,d4oriof,4pxqvr,0.999998323,0.999996646,Brexit,26-06-16

This is a shock during an economic recovery, whatever way one tries to slice it and the idea of a unified Britain, looks more doubtful than ever before to the point that a Scotexit looks highly likely and deals between N.Ireland and the Republic set to be EU orientated more than British orientated. This is good news for many people, maybe even rightly so, but this was not planned by the Brexit political front. The geographical implications of this referendum is also shocking news... for Brexit and all. So what has happened is much greater than those who voted to Leave expected. The remain campaign didn't run much by the concept either did it? So people who voted leave must be asking themselves, is this really the result I expected? Is that what I want to happen.There appears to be a clear difference between voting for a Brexit and the world those same voters woke up in the next day. If they knew what they do now, would they have voted the same?I would like to see how the house of commons would respond to that among themselves.Sadly though Britain can't really loose face as Cameron has said there will be no going back.

For one, the many British online stores that have been selling to customers EU-wide can no longer do so. Europeans aren't willing to pay toll fees, and the business will move to online stores in Germany, France and other EU countries. And sure, the UK can follow in the footsteps of Norway in terms of trade agreements with the EU, but that will mean that the only difference from the original agreement is that the UK no longer has any say in it as they are not a member - they can only abide by the rules.But since you're so optimistic: can you tell me _just one example_ where business has been restricted by these ""silly European dictates""? What is this magical sector of business that will now blossom? Do tell. PS.

You can furnish no compelling or credible evidence that they ""intend to leave"". Zero.

Lot of brave British men and women have given all they had to protect democracy, now some of us don't want it because we didn't get the result we wanted, well shame on you all. This country has survived two world wars, the depression, power worker strikes, the 3 day week, miners strikes and even Margret Thatcher and we came out the other and we will come out of this stronger to. To those in the 18-30 age group who think that the older voter has high jacked the vote how dare you be so insulting as to even suggest that our votes were selfish. I wont be around in 30 years to see a crumbled NHS that has succumbed to the pressure, we already have an aging population (and that's not our fault either) that is causing our welfare system to creak. Our welfare state is the envy of the world not just Europe and our aim should be to protect it whatever it takes. I firmly believe if we stayed in the EU our welfare state would be bankrupt within the next 15 to 20 years, just around the time you 18-30 year olds just might need it. Why should we bow to the unelected faceless decision makers in Brussels. Now British MP's you cant hide behind the (our hands are tied by Brussels)  excuse, now start earning your over paid salary and doing what we ask or you will be next. Those like myself who voted to leave are not racist or bigots but a group wanting to help our proud country regain its own destiny.

5258,2,FeeltheBernBaby16,"The Dirty Brexit Secret You Need to Know about Age and the Brexit I work for a marketing agency, and one of the areas that we specialise in is politics. If you somehow donâ€™t know, it is now possible to create terrifyingly complete profiles of online users and our company sells those to political groups for election and issue research. We watched the build up to the Brexit vote and created vast, detailed assortments of profiles for both sides. As part of that, we got to know the people of the UK well as we collected all of this data. Here is what we found:1. Computers and internet access, in general, run conversely to age, (i.e.-the older the citizen, the less likely they have their own).In closed monitoring (general data collection gathered through search engines), we found that, despite the above fact (that the older the citizen the less likely they are to own a computer or have internet access) there was an inverse proportion to time spent researching Brexit. Even though those 18-24 had the greatest access to personal computers and the internet, they actually spent the least amount of time researching it.On terminals belonging to those 18-24, an average of 37 minutes was observed relating to Brexit research. On terminals belonging to those 55+, an average of 691 minutes was observed conducting research related to the Brexit.We followed and conducted online surveys to this point, and the results were horrifying. The survey was a selected cross-sample and each participant volunteered their own answers (the survey was conducted the day of voting).88% of those 18-24 admitted that they spent less than one hour researching the Brexit. 19% admitted to spending less than 10 minutes.81% of those 24-29 admitted they spent less than an hour.77% of those 30-35 acknowledged that they spent less than an hour researching.Conversely, not one single respondent aged 65 or higher spent less than 30 minutes.On average, they spent 18 hours researching, 11% spent more than 20 hours. In contrast, not even a single respondent in the 18-24 age group said they spent this much time researching.The 65+ age group went to libraries, used community computers, and arranged to use family member's computers, and they invested amazing amounts of time leading up to the vote.Here's the dirty secret, (and what is so infuriating) we sold this data to several Remain groups, we briefed them on the surprisingly little research being done by those in the lower age brackets, and we told them of the disparate averages among older voters. In response, they literally crafted a message to cover this up. At the heart of their messaging was that ""only stupid people vote Leave."" From the celebrities they rolled out, to the ads, the undertone was the same, if you are smart and sophisticated, you will vote to stay. They determined that their supporters were not concerned with the facts and they created a campaign that appealed to vanity. The very idea behind the messaging was that you do not need to do any research for yourself, if you are smart, you will side with Remain. If you have ever used the response that the Leave voters are stupid, you are not some creative genius, you are merely regurgitating a line crafted by a soulless bureaucrat who thought you would be gullible enough to say it for them, for free. Congrats on proving them correct, I guess.As a result, here's the part that no one is talking about now. Much has been made of the fact that Google trends revealed that there was a surge in searches related to the EU and what it means to leave, etc. What no one is saying is WHO is doing the searches. The reality is, we have profiles for each I.P. address (whether they are likely a Leave or Remain voter). 9/10 people who searched ""What is the EU?"" and ""What does it mean to leave the EU"" after the vote, did so from a terminal identified as a Remain supporter (68% of those after-the-vote searches were conducted on devices owned by someone under 24). They were so confident that the UK would vote to Remain, that they never seriously researched what a Leave vote would even mean.On average, terminals identified to be owned by a Leave supporter did about five hours of research, while the average Remain supporter researched just 44 minutes.Out firm has some pretty mean NDAs in place, so I cannot disclose anything beyond this.The factual reality is the older population made far more of an effort and spent considerably more time researching than the average younger voter.  If you are publically decrying the intellect of those who voted to Leave, you are repeating a line crafted for you by someone who counted on you being gullible enough to do so.(Edit: Had a pint too many in building up the courage to post this and it came across harsher than I meant it.  I softened the language to make it more congruous to my original intent).",NA,NA,4pv16g,8.18E-15,-1,Against,26-06-16

5263,2,batusfinkus,"1 All Important Reason Why Brexit Was A Stunning Success So much 'doom' type hysteria in leftist media of late and they are rather dreary articles and reports. The issue right now is that socialists around the globe are in shock that an individual nation would leave a collective. *If the Brit's do this then what is to stop other nations from doing the same?* the comrades are asking themselves. Well, let's ponder the most positive outcome FOR THE ENTIRE GLOBE because of Brexit.# BORDERS NEED TO BE DETERMINED BY INDIVIDUAL NATION STATES If germany wants to publicly open its doors and let a million in then that is germany's right to do so but, when the magnificent teutons begin preaching about their kindhearted superiority along with their economic might that sees them financially prop up greece and will soon see them propping up the rest of the PIIIGS then the UK doesn't have to listen to it. In fact the UK has the right to mock germany for its magnificence / it's ability to sow a crop of time bombs.Self-determination does not mean *endure the whining of the eu bureaucrats* and if other nations, indeed smaller nations even, within the eu wish to prevent syrians or Africans from settling within their sovereign borders then that is their right to do so. It may or may not be the moral thing to do but it is never for a great economic power (like germany) to pressure other nations in the eu to give more or provide more. The eu has simply become another un with 'kindhearted' socialists preaching to others about what they should do with their money.Now, all the kindhearted giving aside, if a single male syrian aged around 22 is allowed into germany and is given an EU passport, it should be the right of every nation on the planet to deny that man entry to their nation. Other nations on earth should have the right to deny that man entry into their nation without having to worry about germany howling about trade. #Especially when suicide bombers/gunmen are statistically more likely to be aged between 14 and 46 years old and be Muslim, male, single and of Middle Eastern extraction.If germany or sweden etc sows a crop of dissatisfied time bombs then germany etc should reap them for itself ! Those 'refugees' shouldn't be granted immediate entry into any other nation on earth because of their newly acquired and thoroughly vile eu passport- a passport which relies on economic might to wedge open borders. This is the key issue and will continue to be the key issue. It should annoy you that because of eu economic might that anyone with an eu passport is granted access to your nation.If 7 jihadist males can hijack two planes and crash them into the heart of New York then imagine what thirty men trying to obtain radium from unsecured hospitals (or even clock factories) all around the globe can do. A dirty bomb doesn't rely on fission or fusion for a dirty bomb is all about the target ingesting radioactive particles via breathing or drinking. One dirty bomb in a supermarket is enough to cause miserable life-sapping lung cancer in over 500 people which is more than most bombs take out for *a dirty bomb doesn't even have to explode*- it can be theoretically achieved with air conditioning units over a period of weeks.We've had 3 days of leftwit howling in the media and now the UK needs to be congratulated. I'm sure that if Scotland had have witnessed a UK soldier being beheaded as he walked along a Glasgow street then the Scot's would be rethinking their borders and their past and future refugee/immigrant intake as well.One of the bombers who detonated the bomb that blew the bus apart in London was from Ayslesbury- that's a smallish town that I lived in for 6 months back in the late 1980's. I'm sorry to say it but the UK has already sown a crop of time bombs but you can and are beginning to say 'NO MORE'. Wonderful and good for you. Southern Europe will become a mecca for bombers/suicide gunmen in the next few years and it will be lax borders within the eu that is the real problem. In Australia we built the dingo fence (largest fence on earth) and it works as long as it is maintained. Don't let the uninformed left pick your borders apart- say goodbye to the eu if the eu diminishes your security in any way and if leftwits in the media howl at you about how you spend your tax then tell them to 'Go spend your own money for a change'.

5290,2,Appleplex,"My Vomit On A Disgusting Full English Brexit http://www.thelittlereview.com/current-affairs/full-english-brexitBrexit sounds like some kind of greasy English breakfast eaten just before lunchtime with a hangover outside a tube station.Not quite breakfast, not quite lunch - brunch in fact but definitely bacon and eggs-related with plenty of baked beans and perhaps taken with you on the Euro Tunnel.It's an ugly word and it stands for ugly sentiments. It's so British and ugly the world forgot to notice it existed until it was too late. No one else has fried mushrooms for breakfast either.I forgot to vote because I was in Australia and had assumed it would come to nothing. How could Britain realistically leave the EU?But now that it has happened, it doesn't surprise me the British have shot themselves in the foot. It was the British culture that drove me away to better circumstances.Like everything else, this is like poetic justice as you watch your opponents follow a wrongful course that finally becomes responsible for their own undoing.It's like the lights going out in a pub that didn't pay you, two years afterwards, because they can't afford to pay the bills or staff. Everyone was on their side at the time.Maybe I've just been away too long to know what's happening there, but the sight of former London Mayor Boris Johnson unseating the more measured David Cameron as Prime Minister rang alarm bells that sound the danger advertised by the ridiculous.Johnson, at a distance, is apparent as a buffoonish leader of jilted causes, crabbing his way into the limelight on lower values. The same referendum voters wave British flags on the Queen's birthday and sing Rule Britannia.My parents voted to Leave. They have nothing else to do and actually believe what they read in newspapers and see on TV. My younger brother voted Remain and was concerned about his country's future.The dead have voted to leave the EU. Now the rest have to live with the decision. What stands out is the pompous national pride the English (and it was mostly the English) hold so dear, as a surrogate for genuine national achievement.God knows what the Welsh were thinking. The Scottish wanted to stay and now they'll have to try and get out of Britain all over again. The English want to drag them along in their national imperial pretension.You could see the stunned faces of the ambitious, optimistic young, and the chuffing, almost Dickensian self importance of the UKIP Party. This is a long way from the New Labour Britain that pushed me off the edge of Cornwall in 2009.I liked being in the EU. I liked having a passport to every country in Europe, where the weather is better and the women prettier. Now I've been curtailed by a lot homebound hooligans from Hemel Hempstead who presume a connection to Buckingham Palace.Forever. Britain is a place of snobbery and isolation. The only hope for a way forward is with Donald Trump and a new Reagan era behind the banking sector. Actually I'm down with that. But they won't be feeling it in Sunderland.I've been watching British Fascism for a while though now. The Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012 really brought home something was wrong. How could so many people put so much stock in something so trivial?What is it with them and their monarchy? What you wanted to see was the Sex Pistols having a go. ""God save the Queen, the Fascist regime..."". But this time around, the Jubilee had no opposition. The Royal Family represents a disavowal of responsibility for our world. The British deserve to come under attack over it. But they keep retreating into a place no one understands. I'll bet David Cameron regrets holding a Plebiscite. The answer is in the word itself. He opened a question to the common people and they reacted like a starving crowd would in the Middle Ages.They voted for a clown whose appeal is in his ruling-class tolerance of their bangers-and-mash conservatism, which fellow Etonian Cameron was too high minded to mingle with. The mob voted posh and they've finally stormed the Tower Of London.What this really represents is a Peasants Revolt, behind a man who looks like a medieval reaper. It's ridiculous that Johnson should leap to the reigns of government on the back of Democracy. Won't it be a farce if he becomes the Prime Minister?Britain must be in a lot more trouble than I thought. It's hard not to ascertain the message they are sending and reciprocate. To hell with them.

5292,2,Kosteevo,"The 5 Stages of Brexit. Itâ€™s roughly 3am. Itâ€™s a humid, sticky time, giving hope for sunshine the next day. But as I sit here in the dark, watching a glowing box in the corner of a cramped room through a haze of smoke and cheap liquor, itâ€™s becoming more and more clear that there may not be such sunshine to come. A rather charming if hassled man is on the screen, he pauses and stares into space so often and trance like itâ€™s as if he waits on the very word of god before speaking. He is explaining in slow motion that this great country wants to be great, on its own, thank you very much. We are to be ripped from the mothering teat of the EU on which we have suckled for 40 years. The man looks slightly worried. He throws over to the guests he currently has; a fickle bunch of morons who refuse to even speculate on the thing they are here to talk about. These cold blooded reptiles couldnâ€™t summon an ounce of feeling if their life depended on it. They will slither away after their non answers to some swanky all night party in a privileged house, and make way for the next round of blandness to creep in. They answer questions he wasnâ€™t asking. If people were just given the facts instead of hyperbole and sensationalism, would that make a difference? You can see the confusion in their eyes. The level of denial is almost pitiful. Is this actually happening? Both sides seemed shocked. The money men however do not sleep at times like this. Hereâ€™s a report saying the pound has dropped the sharpest it has for 30 years. Shit. Are we falling apart already? The seams of civilisation fraying at the edge. How long it would take to descend into madness? Weeks? Days? It feels like itâ€™s already started. While most will celebrate or mourn the next day, the smell of change is in the air. Itâ€™s faint, but itâ€™s there. The times they are always a changinâ€™. But the wretched hounds at the banks donâ€™t care; this is a time for someone to make a killing one way or another so they are prowling with hunger in their eyes. They donâ€™t care about the outcome, they will always have their money stored away, an exit strategy planned for every eventuality. Rest assured my fellow country folk; as the world is pushed overboard at the hands of these foul depraved gamblers, they will start knocking walls down to have quadruple sized rooms. The hassled man, throwing out figures, statistics and place names as fast as he can, is being swamped under a river of numbers, pulled down by the current into the murky depths as he fights to keep afloat. Fuck him. Let him drown. His almost hypnotic repetition of numbers that wonâ€™t mean anything except non speculation from the wispy ghosts of guests for another couple of hours; is beginning to grate on me. Is that because I feel like Iâ€™m losing? It feels like a team sport. You got your side and you wanna kick the ass of the other side, right? If he was reporting different streams of data would I be celebrating, high fiving friends and tweeting him to say what a great job he is doing in the face of a tidal wave of information?  Cheering every result that goes my way and booing when they donâ€™t. He pauses and stares again, it adds a beautifully unintentional tension to what is already a dog fight that looks like itâ€™s gonna go down to the wire. Dog fights are always bloody. And they always leave a mark. â€œWe now send you to another provincial town for resultsâ€.  They vote leave. The man says thatâ€™s not a surprising vote from the numbers they had. My blood boils a little more...  did he just dismiss every person in that borough as â€˜not as important as these other numbers I haveâ€™? This is an every vote counts situation asshole. No normal constituencies where itâ€™s about seats. 1 person, 1 vote, most wins. I may not agree with their viewpoint, but it sure counts for much more respect than the man is giving them. I need a drink. Shit. Out. I rummage through a set of drawers and pull out a collection of mini Jager bottles. I must have something else. Ouzo. Double shit. Jager it is then. I neck a couple to calm my blood and roll another.Ok, so letâ€™s think this through. If we leave, then what happens? What do I need to worry about apart from the fact the country now has to renegotiate every contract with every nation, those in or out of the EU? Will people happily trade? How long will these deals take? This sounds like a good number of years before we are financially stable on our own two feet. Does that make it a recession? The vote leave camp says we can make our own rules and fund out own NHS. When? And who decides on these rules? They were already making huge cuts in hospitals over the last few years; will this cut the vein deeper?  Maybe it will help them. But what happens when you take away the future?  Uncertainty panics everyone.  It starts off small but spreads like a virus. Human beings are selfish at their core and if itâ€™s a kill or be killed situation, most would fight. When things go awry on any level you see the national conscious look out for number one. A hypothetical fuel shortage and everyone is suddenly filling up. Damned animals.

Meat for weeks for their hungry horde.  A sickening disease sweeping over a nation like a pestilence; some go mad, some get angry, others hoard and hide and others fight back. All of them dangerous. I look over at the beautiful woman in my bed. Sheâ€™s not from here. Will they try to take her away? Will I have to marry her just to keep her here? My heart jumps to my brain, taking over every rational sense of me. I want to wake her, talk to her, comfort her, and let her know I wonâ€™t let her leave, but she doesnâ€™t need this bleak outlook to spoil her night. Everyone that has a heart has watched someone sleep. Itâ€™s serene and surreal. Most times you are overwhelmed and so happy that they are so peaceful. Unscarred by the grinding monotony of a life she gives so much too only to receive so criminally little back. This idiot here included.  Sheâ€™ll have to deal with that when she wakes up tomorrow.  I wonâ€™t let them take her from me. Iâ€™ll do what it takes. Iâ€™ll sell everything I own if thatâ€™s whatâ€™s needed. We will sort something out. But for now her serenity has calmed me. I sink the last Jager and sit back. One way or another it looks like thereâ€™s another fight coming. I rest and the man is still speaking, listening to god and sending us all over the country. The name of my old home town flashes across the bottom of the screen. They vote leave. Itâ€™s like a dagger to my soul. I canâ€™t handle this. I finish my smoke and lie down, becoming enchanted by the soft tone of these beige politicians. Whatever will be will be.I wake in the morning to the sounds of sirens. Jesus. Is the world collapsing already? Are the hoards roaming the streets? My brain reacts with fear and starts to work out escape routes and weapons to fight them off. The TV is still on. Leave won. I pump up the volume to see what happens now. The prime minister resigns. Like an under qualified coach he canâ€™t take us any further. Wow. Now the Scottish minister is saying there will â€œmost likelyâ€ be another referendum so Scotland can remain in the EU.  As things progress the leader of the opposition is given a vote of no confidence. Parties are beginning to crumble. England is at loggerheads with its neighbours. The fight gets ever closer. Weâ€™ll have a new prime minister by October. 3 months! Then if another general election isnâ€™t called the 2nd place person gets to discuss the exit? What if they were a remain voter? They would have to go and do something that they find truly repugnant. Would they get a good deal for us? The best deal at least?  I watch speech after speech and hear from political commentators all across Europe. Some people are upset. Some people are ok. We have no idea what happens now. Processes have to be started, maybe. Thereâ€™s definitely a feeling that the vote is being respected by all. Thatâ€™s a good start, right? People are still reporting with almost an air of disbelief in their voices, but also an element of acceptance. This is our path forward and we do it together. Some incredulous idiots are starting a petition to have another referendum. Show some respect for yourself you egotistical beasts. Democracy has spoken. Sure, itâ€™s a shock, but itâ€™s happened. Now stop crying that you didnâ€™t get what you want, mewling and whining like a spoiled brat. Stop your tantrum and be the adult you claim to be. Accept the result and move on. It is how life works. It seems that now, more than ever on this island of ours that we need to come together. To be united. To work towards our future as one. To achieve things, to make this the right decision. The sun is high in the sky and the sunny morning appears to bring hope in the mist of confusion. You can already see the politicians starting to jostle for position, lining up to be in the right place when things change again. Itâ€™s an opportunity for those hungry for advancement and thereâ€™s no shortage of young cubs ready to take a swing at the pack leader. Whatever happens, we move on, just like in any aspect of life, relentlessly, grinding, pushing into the future. A future that in a world of connections, we will do alone.",NA,NA,4pxam0,1,1,Brexit,26-06-16

Call every white person who voted Leave a ""racist"", ignoring the fact that Europeans are also white. Make sure you ignore and marginalise ethnic minority leave voters.2.) Claim that the (huge) turnout wasn't high enough. 72%? It should have been at least 75%! 80%? It should have been 85%! Make sure to keep moving the goalposts.3.) Make a stupid e-petition demanding another referendum, just like the socialists did when Labour lost last year. We need to keep having referendums until we get the ""right"" result.4.) Get over-excited about the economy, even if the impact has been pretty boring and mundane. Pretend that your 2:2 in English Literature makes you an expert on currency markets.5.) Attack the very idea of Democracy, because it's only a good thing when it goes the way you want it to. Working class voters don't know what's good for them, but middle class liberals definitely do.6.) Share memes bashing Brexit, ignoring the unwelcome and uncomfortable realisation that you are in the minority of public opinion.7.) Boldly claim that Scotland will leave the UK, forgetting that A) they can't afford to B) the EU can't afford to take them C) 1.6m remain votes don't cancel out 2m NO votes.8.) Make fun of Boris Johnson while sweating slightly and really hoping he doesn't become Prime Minister.9.) Learn absolutely nothing from the campaign, blaming the result on everyone but yourself.

5337,2,Kalnder,"We have to move on and be optimistic.. TL;DROkay, It's been around two days since we heard the UK had decided to leave the EU. A move I am not totally in favour of. But I am not one to challenge the electoral vote.The vote has been cast and all that remains is for us to support our country in the direction it will take next. I'm seeing a lot of remain supporters claim the vote was unfair and unjust. (Personally I believe there is some discrepancy when a majority wins by less than 4% but a majority is a majority- that is democracy and I can't argue that). There are also a lot of people petitioning for a 2nd Referendum. This also goes against democracy. When the majority has spoken you cannot then say ""No, ignore democracy, give us another vote so we can get what we want""Yes, it has been apparent that some people have changed their views on Brexit and would vote the other way, but the vote has already been cast.I have also seen a lot of remain supporters outright call leave supporters ""bigoted racists"" Here's a fact: You will find bigots and racists everywhere. . But there are benefits as to why a Brexit can be considered a good move for Britain. Its time we all look at the positives rather than the negatives at this point, these are the things we need to keep in mind as we move forward, instead of drowning each other in hate-speech.> Britain has spoken and decided it wants to distance itself from the ever increasing Anti-democratic EU parliament. European commission is un-elected. We as people do not get a say in who is elected as member or what sort of legislation they may pass. European law ranks higher than British Law, so they can impose any sort of legislation they desire and parliament and the people have no control over it. Now we can look to a place where we can have more of a say on legislation.> The Euro is not a stable currency and has been in decline for years. It clearly has it's flaws as was proven by the bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The UK refused to join the common currency project and join the euro. This has distanced our self from also heading for the same economic disaster. The EU economy has been getting continuously worse, why should we include ourselves in a proven decline?>The proposed EU army.. The EU is the new soviet state? This only furthers the idea that the EU wants to become the next super-state. We don't need a USSR mark II. And Britain has decided it doesn't want to be involved in this imposed power play.>The Brexit vote has shaken up the EU state members and other EU members. It gives them a wake up call to realise that something needs to change. It gives other far right campaigners in other countries such as Marine Le Pen in France traction to spark their own Referendum.>People now fear that their international travels will be effected.Unlikely. New trade deals will likely have is on board the EEA Agreement which includes free movement of people.""The pound dropped in price, we lost Â£100 Billion, this is only damaging to our economy""Yes, this happened. But the pound is also now stable.(For now) All we can do at this point is to negotiate our trade deals accordingly. The loss might be a worth while price to pay to avoid us having to go through with the EU parliaments corrupt elites any further.A Brexit vote also has cultural implications on a global scale:In the past few years the world has seen a rise in the Regressive Left and brainwashed Liberals. The type of people who want to ban ""free speech"" In order to create safe spaces so people don't get offended by what the left calls ""hate speech"" .>In the regressive Left world, you label people as racists, bigots, Islamophobics when someone gives their opinions of terrorism regardless of the facts they give.>In the Brainwashed Liberals world, ""oppressed"" cultural minorities should be respected and defended even though these *oppressed minorities* are just as forwards and aggressive as they see ""everyone else"". (Just have a look at some of the Black lives matter campaigns and Feminist campaigns. Honestly some of it is ridiculous.) >The regressive left has also given traction to radical feminism on issues such as the gender pay gap and female sexualisation. In the left world, If you mention an argument against feminist ways, you can be labelled as someone who ""hates women"" even though your arguments are perfectly valid.>The Regressive left has given rise to political correctness gone mad. Extreme censorship now sweeps the political world - No wonder the people think they are being spoon fed lies by politicians. They have to make these sort of lies to favour the brainwashed liberals. This is why people like Donald Trump is becoming more popular. People want out with censorship and want to say what they really think. (Despite that I still hate the man)The leave vote has sparked a voice in the right wing which wants to stand against this ridiculous censorship, bureaucracy and corruption. We as a country have chosen a path of freedom rather than staying in the EU out of fear, because we fear what we would be like without it.We aren't going into an apocalypse. We only will if we keep on making the outcome of the vote hostile and negative. I'm done feeling bad for the result outcome. What's done is done.

5375,2,MoLoLu,"The most notable political gain kinda got thrown out the window when Article 50 wasn't triggered immediately. The UK is in no position to negotiate a favorable exit anymore because they missed the chance to take initiative and lead an anti-EU movement, setting an example for other states that would really endanger the EU, thus improving the UK's (relative) position in European politics. Instead Brussels is none too subtly saying Britain must respect its own democratic decision, while the British political elite are refusing to decisively commit to exactly that. The message being sent here is... not promising, to say the least, and is making the whole Brexit campaign look like a farce.Anyways, benefits of Brexit are not being forced into the Euro, which may or may not become compulsory soon. And you can refuse EU regulation that might hurt the UK if you're so inclined (and can accept the risks involved). Your market will be further de-coupled from the Eurozone, which is probably, maybe a good thing. You'll still be attached to the Eurozone by geographic implication and will probably need to accept some (presumably all) EU regulation to keep doing business with the mainland. That, or accept deals that aren't in the UK's favor, which would force you into other markets on just as unfavorable terms.Assuming you actually can and do go with being in the European market, you'll probably be in the ballpark of Switzerland and Norway, countries which have more of less functional economies. But they aren't strictly speaking unrelated to the Euro, as any dip the Euro takes will make your country unable to compete with the Eurozone â€“ risky affair to say the least. Switzerland is already up shit creek with this and lost what little was left of its manufacturing industry during and shortly after the 2012 crisis (despite not even being in the EU; Euro fluctuation coupled with aborted trade talks was enough to kill the industry, much like in the UK, I believe?). We had to peg the Swiss Franc for years just to remain competitive and we really haven't quite recovered. Also, you'll be at risk of being financially bullied by Brussels, with strange cuts and backhanded economic slaps. Swiss politics set a fairly good example here: a constant tightrope dance to maintain sovereignty without accidentally ticking off the EU and risking some obscure but hugely beneficial deal.Another major benefit is full control over your borders, such as is the case here in Switzerland but that comes with a huge but attached. Namely, if you want in on the European market in an even remotely competitive way, you have to adopt the free movement of people laws, and you'll still have to deal with your own internal asylum/immigration debates. As bad as EU legislation might be in this regard, at least in the EU you can blame Brussels for that one. Once it's in your own hands, there's only your own government to blame for any mismanagement, and that can really cause a lot of bumps in the road. If you think Remainers are bad now, see what comes from the left when you actually try to close the borders or deal with questions of asylum. Even Switzerland couldn't really do it, and we're one of the most conservative countries in Europe today.Another very interesting case is the sovereignty argument; more specifically: how much the EU will meddle in your internal affairs. Switzerland found out the hard way that Brussels can bring quite a lot of weight to bear on internal politics, especially if it's even remotely related to the Eurozone. We aren't so much 'free' of the EU as playing an endless game of whack-a-mole with our economy at stake. It's hilariously sad to watch our politicians dance around in an endless circle of appeasement while struggling to keep Switzerland apart from the EU. Despite the fact that we're bang smack in the middle of it. At least you in the UK got some geographic distance.On the negotiating trade deals thing, that's a bit of a red herring. You can, frankly, but you have to build up first and then be super competitive too,which is hard when anyone looking to do business in Europe can go to Germany and secure a better deal supported by the rest of the Eurozone and its cheap labor. Another point is you can't do business with anyone in Europe or Schengen without the EU getting mixed up in it so at least half your current exports (I think?) that could possibly get whacked with unfavorable taxes if you don't follow the rules of the free trade area. What you can do is work more freely in international trade, but that puts you up against the rest of the world and may end up with Britain playing second fiddle to American and Chinese interests, or whoever happens to be interested in the relevant market. I'm not sure the UK alone can actually bring the political and financial weight to make much of a difference on the global stage. It's possible but I don't see how it can be done given the current state of affairs. Presumably relations with the Commonwealth would have to be built up first, and then there'd be enough weight behind the UK to actually achieve anything notable. That or you'd have to go with Russia? Or America? I dunno. Commonwealth sounds a better option here to me, but who knows what big business will push for â€“ and who wants to deal with the UK after this fiasco is over. Any international deal could go sideways in so many ways, depending on what decisions get made after a successful Brexit. Also depends a lot on what happens in geopolitics in the years to come, and what state the UK is in when it tries to build up these trade relations. The EU put quite a lot of time and effort into securing its deals. I'd imagine you'll have a hard time maneuvering around those, and the UK would need a better - preferably more tactful - foreign policy to handle such an undertaking.Long story short: the UK isn't in a hopeless bargaining position. Outside of the EU that is. So that gives you aleg up over other non-EU states like the Swiss examples I brought. But any ""good news"" scenario first assumes the UK pulls its act together and gets this whole Brexit thing through. And we really can't say what will happen then because, well, we don't know if or when Brexit will happen or how fast - and no negotiation can really be undertaken until that part is done. So it's a little difficult to discuss positives at the moment, since conditions as they exist today might not by the time the break happens.",d4p5ihy,4pzh42,4pzh42,0.094496862,-0.811006277,Against,27-06-16

But you've never actually seen any study, have you? You just huffed and puffed because my post destroyed the premise of your post; and like the angry Brexiters who refused to realize that immigration doesn't bring in terrorism you doubled down on your mistake rather than admit it. It's so sadly predictable.Sorry if it destroys your particular pre-conceptions, but _posturing_ that more time spent = better educated person had _always_ been a false premise to begin with. You don't become smarter because you spent 8 years studying for a 4 year undergrad course. Brexit is an _extremely_ simple issue especially for the Remain camp - a continuation of the status quo - whereas the Leave camp had always been a cesspool of delusional liars who now have to admit they couldn't actually spend 350 million pounds on the NHS like they promised. Leave didn't need to ""do more research"", they had to spend more time repeating lies to themselves in order to justify a monumental decision that may in fact very well lead to the dissolution of Great Britain (which I personally feel is a good thing, the British sense of entitlement that they are a special people - which is little more than a sick positive spin on racism/racial superiority ideas - is becoming tiring).And really, that you refused to answer whether or not the Leavers were even aware that the vast majority of terrorist attacks occur in the Middle East and Pakistan and the vast majority of the victims are Muslim - therefore demonstrating anyone afraid of Islamic terrorist in the West may as well be afraid of being struck by lightning - shows how _shallow_ your understanding of knowledge transmission is. If they did 5-18 hours of research _efficiently_, they should know this. I confirmed this particular tidbit with less than an hour of Google research. That you're remaining mum about this single most important facet of the immigration = terrorism issue - everything else is frankly lies and white noise - really makes you a perfect example of how people would rather burn the world down than to give up on their preconceived notions.People as a whole are _not_ very well-informed about politics. Pretending that the Leavers are exempt from this because they ""did more research"" while ignoring the entire circle-jerk and pre-conception issue really shows why pretty much nobody believed your argument.

Oxford and Cambridge universities are basically extensions of the city of London, there is a huge cultural and economic gap in both towns between the university and the townsfolk.

He succeeded and won. He was irresponsible to offer a referendum and obviously did not want any change before he even pledged to do a referendum.Yes you quoted his speech, tbh his speech is just a lot of old toss, basically a way of saying, I know longer control the situation and I'm leaving.Now, the thing about fucking over leave campaigners is very interesting. I'll link you to a comment that's been floating around twitter, all the claims the guy makes are true and fact checked, it's gone viral, it's a few paragraphs to read but it's so interesting and talks about a lot of stuff I wasn't even aware of. This is basically my 'source' for how cameron has fucked over brexit leaders. Please tell me what you think.COPIED AND PASTED VIRAL COMMENT BEGINS HERE:If Boris Johnson looked downbeat yesterday, that is because he realises that he has lost.Perhaps many Brexiters do not realise it yet, but they have actually lost, and it is all down to one man: David Cameron.With one fell swoop yesterday at 9:15 am, Cameron effectively annulled the referendum result, and simultaneously destroyed the political careers of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and leading Brexiters who cost him so much anguish, not to mention his premiership.How?Throughout the campaign, Cameron had repeatedly said that a vote for leave would lead to triggering Article 50 straight away. Whether implicitly or explicitly, the image was clear: he would be giving that notice under Article 50 the morning after a vote to leave. Whether that was scaremongering or not is a bit moot now but, in the midst of the sentimental nautical references of his speech yesterday, he quietly abandoned that position and handed the responsibility over to his successor.And as the day wore on, the enormity of that step started to sink in: the markets, Sterling, Scotland, the Irish border, the Gibraltar border, the frontier at Calais, the need to continue compliance with all EU regulations for a free market, re-issuing passports, Brits abroad, EU citizens in Britain, the mountain of legistlation to be torn up and rewritten ... the list grew and grew.The referendum result is not binding. It is advisory. Parliament is not bound to commit itself in that same direction.The Conservative party election that Cameron triggered will now have one question looming over it: will you, if elected as party leader, trigger the notice under Article 50?Who will want to have the responsibility of all those ramifications and consequences on his/her head and shoulders?Boris Johnson knew this yesterday, when he emerged subdued from his home and was even more subdued at the press conference. He has been out-maneouvered and check-mated.If he runs for leadership of the party, and then fails to follow through on triggering Article 50, then he is finished. If he does not run and effectively abandons the field, then he is finished. If he runs, wins and pulls the UK out of the EU, then it will all be over - Scotland will break away, there will be upheaval in Ireland, a recession ... broken trade agreements. Then he is also finished. Boris Johnson knows all of this. When he acts like the dumb blond it is just that: an act.The Brexit leaders now have a result that they cannot use. For them, leadership of the Tory party has become a poison chalice.When Boris Johnson said there was no need to trigger Article 50 straight away, what he really meant to say was ""never"". When Michael Gove went on and on about ""informal negotiations"" ... why? why not the formal ones straight away? ... he also meant not triggering the formal departure. They both know what a formal demarche would mean: an irreversible step that neither of them is prepared to take.All that remains is for someone to have the guts to stand up and say that Brexit is unachievable in reality without an enormous amount of pain and destruction, that cannot be borne. And David Cameron has put the onus of making that statement on the heads of the people who led the Brexit campaign.",d4p84k8,d4p5kj3,4psctg,9.20E-13,-1,Against,27-06-16
5405,2,ModestGoals,"The post on Quora doesn't assuage the statistics about income. Did Syria have some cities that were relative modern by Syria standards? Sure... but standard of living is inexorably tied to income, and I doubt too many rural Syrian nomads were posting on Quora. I would also note that when presented with the negative consequences of your own ideals, you tried to imply a convenient, nuanced position, see, that really, 'you weren't in favor of economic migrants from countries other than Syria and that ultimately, you were in favor of them one day going home.'When asked directly about that, you move the goalposts again, to some theoretical abstraction about how ""if we just split all the migrants..."", thus abandoning your earlier position, as you and I both know that's bullshit. You don't believe they're ever going home, you sincerely believe we're somehow obliged to take them all in and tax ourselves to pay for their well being. This is why your particular brand of idealism is horseshit. You're really cloaking yourself with Brandolini's Law here. 130,000 non-productive eaters is a huge burden, particularly for states that have a lavish social safety net or smaller countries that can hardly afford to take care of their own. They are coming and coming and coming, the refugee population figures are not a fixed number and the 'official' number of refugees is radically understated per everything we can estimate, since so many of them are unaccounted for and living in the shadows... and if we just let your suggested policies run, we'd wind up with the entire 3rd world living in Europe. You might be oblivious to the consequences of that now, but you for damn sure wouldn't be once it landed in your neighborhood. As noted, your brand of naive is very hard to reason with since you're apparently sheltered from the enormously negative consequences that occur whenever we put ideals like your into real world practice. That's OK, though. With the situation being as it is, you'll eventually have the red pill shoved down your throat one way or another. If we could devise a magical spell that would keep the consequences of your stupid ideals limited to your sphere of existence, I'd be more than happy to let you drown yourself but sadly, me and mine also have to live in the world naive idealists like you wind up creating. I know how this turns out, I even know the bullshit excuses people like you make when we finally arrive there, for why it didn't quite work out as you had planned.

Hollande rejected Le Penâ€™s call for a referendum today during their meeting; prompting the following from the leader of Franceâ€™s far-right National Front party:â€œWe will see at the presidential election (next year) which candidates commit to organize a referendum.You know I am one of those because for the past four years now Iâ€™ve said that six months after being elected, I would organize a referendum on the exit (of France) from the European Union, and that I would use these six months to negotiate with the European Union its transformation into a Europe of the nations, giving back to the French people four essential elements from its sovereignty: territorial, economic, monetary-budgetary and legislative.â€Therefore, if LePen emerges victorious in next yearâ€™s presidential elections, that means the next major player in the EU after Germany is out and there goes the EU.This entire civil uprising in Europe is underway ever since two months ago when Dutch voters overwhelmingly rejected a Ukraine-European Union treaty. Angela Merkelâ€™s Germany now faces having to pay an extra 3 billion euros a year to the annual EU budget once Britain leaves.1913 Federal Reserve ~ AMERICANS CANâ€™T AFFORD THE FUTURE: THE ROTHSCHILDS[https://politicalvelcraft.org/2015/09/19/americans-cant-afford-the-future-the-rothschilds/]This alone is prompting German government officials to propose that Britain is offered â€œconstructive exit negotiationsâ€ to keep their dues coming in. Some are now talking about a quasi-membership for the UK calling it an â€œassociated partner countryâ€ to keep the money flowing.Yet the French government of Hollande just does not understand. The governor of the French central bank will exert pressure on UK banks. They are taking the view that it would be paradoxical if Britain could retain privileges after the withdrawal from the EU. First Banks are preparing apparently preparing to shift part of its employees in London to the continent. They obviously fail to grasp that it is European continental banks that are on the brink of collapse â€“ not British.DEUTSCHE BANK BUILT THIS: DO YOU WANNA PLAY A GAME? ~ DEATH IS A SURPRISE PARTY.[https://politicalvelcraft.org/2016/05/28/deutsche-bank-built-this-do-you-wanna-play-a-game-death-is-a-surprise-party/]Italian ministers warned on Saturday that the European Union MUST change course or risk total collapse after Britainâ€™s vote to leave the bloc. The Italian Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan said. â€œA double reaction to Brexit is under way, one financial, one political. The financial one, at least until now, is limited. I am more worried about the political one.â€Indeed, the unthinkable is happening. And they worry the pound might crash? Pay attention to the euro.Furthermore, Portugal, with all eyes on Spanish elections, has made a clear threat to The EU (via WSJ: http://www.wsj.com/articles/portugals-left-bloc-calls-for-referendum-on-eu-membership-1466951538):In other words, if The EU dares to pressure Portugal over its fiscal excess, then Portugal will leave.And finally, for now, as if to reinforce the fears of EU dissolution, Slovakiaâ€™s far-right Peopleâ€™s Party launched a petition for a referendum on the countryâ€™s future in the EU.[http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-wrapup-idUSKCN0ZB090]â€œCitizens of Great Britain have decided to refuse the diktat from Brussels. It is high time for Slovakia to leave the sinking European â€˜Titanicâ€™ as well,â€ the party said.Meanwhile, as Armstrong concludes, another critic of the EU has been the leader of Polandâ€™s ruling party. Polandâ€™s Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski also now responded and said that the UK referendum result shows the need for reform of the EU. [https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/europes-current-economy/five-more-countries-want-referendums-to-exit-eu/]â€œThis is bad news for Europe, for Poland. (â€¦) This is a great dilemma for the eurocrats, we all want to keep the EU, the question is in what shape.â€ He continued: â€œWe will be trying to use this situation to make the European politicians aware why this happened. And it happened because this concept, which was created some time ago, is no longer popular in Europe.â€Then again, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n intends to campaign in the British press for the UK to remain in the EU, according to a Hungarian government spokesman. OrbÃ¡n is clearly one of those who is out of touch with the people and fails to understand that a federalized Europe is not going down very well with the people. He is extremely arrogant to think that he has any right to intervene or suggest that the vote be ignored.To add insult to injury, Turkey proclaims the â€œCrusader union falls apartâ€ demonstrating that memories in Europe go back centuries. The United States people did not want to enter World War II. Roosevelt even traveled to Boston promising that American boys would never defend Europe. Boston was a very Irish community and they were upset at being asked to defend Britain after their migration to the USA because of Britain. Old wounds never quite die.As Doug Noland warns:â€œEuropean integration is again under existential threat. And while disintegration will likely unfold over the coming years, a crisis of confidence in the markets could erupt at any point.Confidence in Europeâ€™s banks is faltering badly. I believe faith in the ECBâ€™s capacity to hold the banks and securities markets together is waning.â€How much leverage has accumulated throughout European periphery bond markets? And it is a harsh reality of Europeâ€™s financial structure that de-risking/de-leveraging dynamics tend to see rising yields/widening spreads intensify market fears of bank impairment. Then bank worries further negatively impact sentiment in the markets and business community in a problematic vicious spiral.More: https://politicalvelcraft.org/2016/06/26/civil-uprising-escalates-against-rothschilds-city-of-london-as-8th-eu-nation-threatens-referendum/",d4p8fow,4q0nft,4q0nft,1,1,Brexit,27-06-16

But it was never intended to work. So it's not that they couldn't come up with a contingency plan. It's that they didn't want to waste energy on something they never wanted to do anyways. Why should they? It was clear in their mind that Remain would win â€“ and who in their right minds would reaaaly want to leave the EU, right?I would /facepalm but I've seen similar stunts almost pass here; last time the Swiss went at it we almost wrote unconstitutional additions into our constitution by popular vote.

5447,2,RAndrewOhge,"Why The British Said No To EuropeBy John Pilger - Jun 26, 2016 - ""Information Clearing House""  The majority vote by Britons to leave the European Union was an act of raw democracy. Millions of ordinary people refused to be bullied, intimidated and dismissed with open contempt by their presumed betters in the major parties, the leaders of the business and banking oligarchy and the media.This was, in great part, a vote by those angered and demoralised by the sheer arrogance of the apologists for the ""remain"" campaign and the dismemberment of a socially just civil life in Britain. The last bastion of the historic reforms of 1945, the National Health Service, has been so subverted by Tory and Labour-supported privateers it is fighting for its life.A forewarning came when the Treasurer, George Osborne, the embodiment of both Britain's ancient regime and the banking mafia in Europe, threatened to cut Â£30 billion from public services if people voted the wrong way; it was blackmail on a shocking scale.Immigration was exploited in the campaign with consummate cynicism, not only by populist politicians from the lunar right, but by Labour politicians drawing on their own venerable tradition of promoting and nurturing racism, a symptom of corruption not at the bottom but at the top. The reason millions of refugees have fled the Middle East - first Iraq, now Syria - are the invasions and imperial mayhem of Britain, the United States, France, the European Union and NATO. Before that, there was the willful destruction of Yugoslavia. Before that, there was the theft of Palestine and the imposition of Israel.The pith helmets may have long gone, but the blood has never dried. A nineteenth century contempt for countries and peoples, depending on their degree of colonial usefulness, remains a centrepiece of modern ""globalisation"", with its perverse socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor: its freedom for capital and denial of freedom to labour; its perfidious politicians and politicised civil servants.All this has now come home to Europe, enriching the likes of Tony Blair and impoverishing and disempowering millions. On 23 June, the British said no more.The most effective propagandists of the ""European ideal"" have not been the far right, but an insufferably patrician class for whom metropolitan London is the United Kingdom. Its leading members see themselves as liberal, enlightened, cultivated tribunes of the 21st century zeitgeist, even ""cool"". What they really are is a bourgeoisie with insatiable consumerist tastes and ancient instincts of their own superiority. In their house paper, the Guardian, they have gloated, day after day, at those who would even consider the EU profoundly undemocratic, a source of social injustice and a virulent extremism known as ""neoliberalism"".The aim of this extremism is to install a permanent, capitalist theocracy that ensures a two-thirds society, with the majority divided and indebted, managed by a corporate class, and a permanent working poor. In Britain today, 63 per cent of poor children grow up in families where one member is working. For them, the trap has closed. More than 600,000 residents of Britain's second city, Greater Manchester, are, reports a study, ""experiencing the effects of extreme poverty"" and 1.6 million are slipping into penury.Little of this social catastrophe is acknowledged in the bourgeois controlled media, notably the Oxbridge dominated BBC. During the referendum campaign, almost no insightful analysis was allowed to intrude upon the clichÃ©d hysteria about ""leaving Europe"", as if Britain was about to be towed in hostile currents somewhere north of Iceland.On the morning after the vote, a BBC radio reporter welcomed politicians to his studio as old chums. ""Well,"" he said to ""Lord"" Peter Mandelson, the disgraced architect of Blairism, ""why do these people want it so badly?"" The ""these people"" are the majority of Britons.The wealthy war criminal Tony Blair remains a hero of the Mandelson ""European"" class, though few will say so these days. The Guardian once described Blair as ""mystical"" and has been true to his ""project"" of rapacious war.  The day after the vote, the columnist Martin Kettle offered a Brechtian solution to the misuse of democracy by the masses. ""Now surely we can agree referendums are bad for Britain"", said the headline over his full-page piece. The ""we"" was unexplained but understood - just as ""these people"" is understood. ""The referendum has conferred less legitimacy on politics, not more,"" wrote Kettle. "" ... the verdict on referendums should be a ruthless one. Never again.""The kind of ruthlessness Kettle longs for is found in Greece, a country now airbrushed. There, they had a referendum and the result was ignored.  Like the Labour Party in Britain, the leaders of the Syriza government in Athens are the products of an affluent, highly privileged, educated middle class, groomed in the fakery and political treachery of post-modernism. The Greek people courageously used the referendum to demand their government sought ""better terms"" with a venal status quo in Brussels that was crushing the life out of their country. They were betrayed, as the British would have been betrayed.On Friday, the Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was asked by the BBC if he would pay tribute to the departed Cameron, his comrade in the ""remain"" campaign. Corbyn fulsomely praised Cameron's ""dignity"" and noted his backing for gay marriage and his apology to the Irish families of the dead of Bloody Sunday. He said nothing about Cameron's divisiveness, his brutal austerity policies, his lies about ""protecting"" the Health Service. Neither did he remind people of the war mongering of the Cameron government: the dispatch of British special forces to Libya and British bomb aimers to Saudi Arabia and, above all, the beckoning of world war three.In the week of the referendum vote, no British politician and, to my knowledge, no journalist referred to Vladimir Putin's speech in St. Petersburg commemorating the seventy-fifth anniversary of Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June, 1941. The Soviet victory - at a cost of 27 million Soviet lives and the majority of all German forces - won the Second World War.Putin likened the current frenzied build up of NATO troops and war material on Russia's western borders to the Third Reich's Operation Barbarossa. NATO's exercises in Poland were the biggest since the Nazi invasion; Operation Anaconda had simulated an attack on Russia, presumably with nuclear weapons. On the eve of the referendum, the quisling secretary-general of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, warned Britons they would be endangering ""peace and security"" if they voted to leave the EU. The millions who ignored him and Cameron, Osborne, Corbyn, Obama and the man who runs the Bank of England may, just may, have struck a blow for real peace and democracy in Europe.http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article44970.htm",d4pd4lm,4q15q9,4q15q9,1,1,Brexit,27-06-16

(one of the reasons to leave the EU)Of course, some people is Brussels want to punish the UK and give them a bad deal (you see how nice and befriended they areâ€¦ Or do they just want power?)Luckily many, many members from the EU countries (who are also not so happy with the EU) will be in favor of giving the UK a good deal.

However, at the same time the EU also wants to benefit from the UK so I expect that eventually there will be a good deal and Britain would not need to have many problems, in fact it could grow.I find it hard to make a production on what Scotland will do. But I honestly wonder if they would vote leave. The people voting against a Brexit in Scotland was lower as expected, in fact that was one of the main reasons the polls where wrong. You could say that the Scots allowed for the Brexit. 83% of the Scots voted to leave as well.What I find a little bid disgusting is how the media (well no surprise as they were on the remain side) it talking about how Engels has dragged Scotland out of the EU ( http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21701332-brexit-has-sparked-calls-another-independence-referendum-also-made-it-trickier ).

Then came fear for my own people's desire for a referendum. Now I feel slicktly sick when I think about it.We're unsure what it will do to the economy. But our prime minister Mark Rutter put it like this when asked about a nexit: ""We've started reducing unemployement, we've seen improvements to our economy. Why on earth would throw that away"". When all experts tell you it's a bad idea to set yourself on fire, that's not fear propaganda, that's just an advice describing something you fear. This is going to sound disparaging, but the average person is just too stupid  to understand the implications. People just keep on saying that the economy will recover because all they have seen in their lives is a sine wave in the economy. After rain there will be sunshine. But economic growth happens in stability. And introducing an unknown variable like this will at least halt growth and probably cause a recession. The idea is that you elect people who spend time informing themselves, because sometimes group wisdom isn't.I know the UK has a shitty electrion system, with 47% of the people not representated in government. The politicians have been blaming their mistakes on the EU for years. This was bound to happen.10 years ago I had this vision of Europe. We would slowly grow, we've already seen countries joining. Turkey wants to join and at that point they were working up to it. I hoped that Europe would be an example for the rest of the world. I hoped in the end that Europe wouldn't be limited to the land mass called Europe. We would invite ask Russia to join and slowly there would be less reason for distrust, much like how the EEG did that for their respective countries. It was a utopia, but you broke it. Europe shrunk.I've had discussions with friends who want a nexit. They say stuff like ""People want vacuum cleaners to have power"" referring to a law by EU that limits the power. Yet if you read about the reasons behind the law you'd understand why it is. The EU makes loads of mistakes but it does so much good. And now with global warming we need it more than ever. We need a front to reduce emissions, and these brexit and nexit distractions are as frustrating as watching the people in Westeros squabbling who sits on the Iron  Throne whilst winter is coming.",d4pp3uy,4q2lsb,4q2lsb,0.294362375,-0.41127525,Against,27-06-16

Now all we have to do is explain to all those ""unfavourable, but still in"" that reform isn't and never will be on the table, and the EU will disintegrate.In short, you *have* triggered a bit of a war, but it's not a war between Britain and Europe, it's a war between all european eurosceptics, british or otherwise, and all european europhiles, british or otherwise, and I thank you for it from the bottom of my heart.Our governments all hate your guts though.",d4ppk1x,4q2lsb,4q2lsb,0.911948317,0.823896634,Brexit,27-06-16

It's not assuming poverty, it's a fact that the majority of leave votes came from impoverished areas which are actually those most likely to be affected by leaving. No one thinks they're better than anyone but please remember that a lot of people are hurting right now so mud is going to be flung both ways.2. Yes, Racism has been around since before Brexit but unfortunately the referendum has resulted in a surge of open racism. Not all leavers are racists, but a lot of them are and I have seen the highest levels of racism in this country over the past 3 days than I have in my entire life.3. I'm 27. I'm a  part of the same generation and you can't assume that young people didn't vote because they're lazy. We are at a point where the young people are always under-represented and therefore don't feel like they can get involved in politics because they won't be heard. There's also a matter of lack of education, not that they're stupid but because either a lot of people didn't know where to look for facts, couldn't talk to friends/family comfortably about their views, the media weren't exactly helping much either. We can't just point fingers at the old or young and say 'it's their fault', instead we need to look at ways we can help our generation get involved in politics. My cousin (21) phoned me to ask for advice because her family were divided and she wanted her vote to count but didn't feel she had a strong enough opinion. As I don't want to sway a vote, I asked her what she wanted for her future and gave her my recommendation and also pointed her towards some articles she could read. Unfortunately, not a lot of people have a relationship like that.If ONE good thing happened out of this, it's that young people are actually TALKING about politics so MAYBE there will be more young people at polling stations for the next GE.

No one will be able to afford a decent life except the elite. We've been misled by a certain subset of (IMO) political bastards and it's likely to result in backlash, sooner than later, and probably in a nasty way. The only way this works is is everyone drops from the EU at once. And we over here will still get the shit end of this deal.

But if it comes to many of the other groups.. Well they did not refuse listening to them, they ignored what they had to say after hearing it.  That was deliberately and with a reason. First of all, many of those groups have been giving advices many times in the past, and many of the times they turned out to be false.Also interest might be different. For example, a company prefers people with a lower income, while those people prefer higher income. In fact, one of those experts (canâ€™t remember who it was) even said that a Brexit was bad because the income of the people would go up.Also what many people dislike about the EU is how everything is controlled by the lobby, and the lobby is controlled by many of the organizations you are referring to. Obviously many big business and organizations are in favor of the EU.. they can decide most of the laws being made there. Many of those Brexit voters wanted more democracy, they do not want corporatism.And then universities, well do you mean people who did study there or..? It just depends on what expert you listen to. For example take Daniel Hannan who did study on Oxford, is an MP and did speak in Oxford about the referendum. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzNj-hH8LkYYou simply have been blinded by the â€œBrexit people and dumb old racistâ€ that the media is spreading.",d4prpef,d4pof0a,4q00mb,0.035641874,-0.928716253,Against,27-06-16

Also I am sad about the circle jerk in reddit right now.The EU is the implementation of an idea and the foundation of European unity. The idea is great and unity is also nice, but the foundation is rotten. You can't build anything of worth on this current EU. The EU is extremely undemocratic, which they are showing very openly right now, and the EU is unreformable. Therefore the EU must die, and then you can create a new EU that is better than the old one, if you want to.If the continues for too long, it will lead to an European civil war, or even a world war. Better end it now as peacefully as possible.And the UK did the first step for that, which is extremely brave.Brave, because the EU-Elites don't want the EU to crumble. Therefore they don't want Brittain to look fine after a BREXIT which means that they will attack Brittain economically. Economic warfare is what they will try.People here are fearing the economic problems of the BREXIT, but the economic problems are not consequences of the BREXIT, they are consequeces of the EU being dictatorial. The EU is like a sect who doesn't want their members to leave.And for the reaction of the Brittish people and the European media, it's really disgusting.Democracy means that the majority of the voters decide, and the decision is final even with only 1 vote difference. There is no draw, not neccessary turnout level, no 60% majority required, nothing, because that's all undemocratic.In an election, higher election turnout is always better. Having a low enough election turnout should make you question an election. BUT this wasn't an election, it was a referendum. The turnout of a referendum is irrelevant.The reason is, because in an election, voting should be in everyones interest, but in a referendum or initiative, some people might just not care for various, legitimate reasons.60% majority requirement is equally stupid. What if you have a draw and revote and it's the same? Voting ad infinitum? That would just lead to ""the most stubborn wins"".Repeating a vote is an instrument the government can use to destroy democracy, and it's certainly not smart to give them the option.And now, the most disgusting thing I heard, is that old people should not be allowed to vote, because they won't live for much longer anyway. This is literally Nazi-style shit here and people don't even realize it.You complain about how the old people decided the vote? How about you complain about the young people who didn't vote at all instead?Every Swiss citizen should know it. The outcome of an election or vote is final (as long as the vote wasn't rigged and misinformation isn't the same as rigging the vote) and you have to accept it, even when the difference between yes and no was tiny.Besides, 52% isn't even that close. Switzerland has much closer decisions basically every other year.When I look at [wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_eidgen%C3%B6ssischen_Volksabstimmungen), I find one in 2016 (49.2% pro), one in 2015 (50.1% pro), one in 2014 (50.3% pro) and one in 2012 (50.6% pro).It's rare that people complain too much about one of these close outcomes, but some times even the Swiss do complain. But you can count on it that they (the ones who do complain) will be called undemocratic by many others, because that's what it is.The case of Scotland who voted for remain and now wants it's referendum is shockingly stupid too. They had the right to decide for other parts of the UK, but they won't accept it when it's the other way around? Let's be honest, they should either accept the result of the referendum or they should have left the UK before, probably when the referendum was decided. If you vote, you must accept any outcome, otherwise there is no point in voting at all.And to the media.52% were for BREXIT. BUT our media only shows us sad teens in London.I've read an article about brexit and they inverviewed 5 people in London about it, they only could print maybe two sentences per person. Five times ""oh, that so sad"" and none of the pro-side. How about the media is balanced for once?I've literally seen articles that read like ""This is why the UK is doomed now"", full of tendentious crap.And the politicians are the worst of them.Every EU politician I read about was like ""we should refuse to trade with them, just to show how bad it is outside of the EU"".Guess what, the EU is trading with countries who are not in the EU, pretty much with all of them.

5717,2,Nobody_Anybody,"This is awesomeness in a bottle. Really! I love your reaction, but the big problem isâ€¦ why are you in favor of the EU.1: So that is what you mean.. Well in that case you are right.. If the UK gets a good deal they will probably do very well, proving that the EU is failing (or not necessary) and there are other (better) ways to work together. That results in more countries wanting to leave and the end of the EU.Of course, if they give the UK a bad deal UK and the EU will suffer what might just as well result in the collapse of the EU but in a more painful way.But then again... if it proofs that the EU is failing, why defending the EU? Why would the EU falling apart (to set up something else) be a problem.If you truly believe what you type here, you should wonder what is then still a reason to have this EU. Many of the Brexit people also think they can have a good system of working with other countries without the EU.2: I am just saying that there are possibilities, it is not written in the starts. That the EU might be unwilling to go for a light version again proofs what many people voted leave for. The EU is not so much about working together, but is one government trying to oppose their regulation to countries.3:  Again you are proving the failure of the EU. There is no need for the EU, the only thing you get in the EU, other than if you would simply â€˜work togetherâ€™ if rules that you donâ€™t want forced upon you. The EU not willing to allow countries to have their own rules, is the problem of the EU and again is why people voted to leave.Basically what you have been saying here is the following.. Sure countries can work together without rules being forced upon them, but the EU wants to force those rules upon people.And you are right, but this is exactly why more and more people are against the EUâ€¦ Not against working together. They have no problem with working together, they have a problem with the EU regulations being forced upon them. That might be immigration, but also things like if you are allowed to give out plastic bags for free and so on.Many people in Europe say â€œLetâ€™s work together, trade and be friend, but also respect each other national laws, not trying to force our national laws upon one another.â€ And those people are voting to leave the EU.And if the EU is not willing to make such a deal, it will also only strengthen the dislike towards the EU in other countries, who then also want to leave.. knowing that they might have the same problem, but also knowing that once enough countries have left they are not dependent from the EU anymore.",d4pvknh,d4pum2m,4q0ei6,0.999979181,0.999958362,Brexit,27-06-16

Calling the EU a cult is a bit extreme though, but there's definitely a hivemind that the EU should be out of questioning, because touching it would lead to WW3 or something ridiculous. Many EU-rophiles also seem completely unable to understand there are some Europeans (many, in fact) who have a fundamentally different vision of the future of the European Continent (one that doesn't include WW3, I mean), which might be based on different premises.

It's the least shitty system of all possible systems.1)  Firstly, lets just shoot down the entire idea that the UK can get a sweet deal out of this.  It's a non starter.  The EU would collapse BEFORE it could give the UK a good deal, since the moment that people know that leaving the EU would result in a good deal the entire thing will fall apart.  There are only two path that EU can reasonably take here.  One is to offer the UK a Switzerland or Norway style deal, which is access to the single market with free labour movement.  This is even worse than what British voters have just shot down.  The other is to kick the UK out of the single market and go with something closer to what the Canadians have negotiated in the CETA.  The problem with option 2 is that the UK is not in the single market, which hurts both the EU and UK but the latter a lot more than the former.  The EU can survive this, but the UK will take a pretty bad beating.2)  Again, the EU won't go for it, for the reasons I've already stated.  It's political suicide.  The most you can get with ""light version"" will be free trade agreement, which is a huge step from single market.3)  I'm not sure you fundamentally understand what the EU is.  The EU is an economic union with a minor political apparatus attached to it.  All of the rules that you talk about are basically what holds the European single market together.  If every country can apply their own rules then there is no single market.  Free movement of capital, labour, and goods will all be restricted based on the rules of each country.  Once that occurs, the most you can hope for is an European Free Trade Zone similar to NAFTA.  This arrangement is probably one that the British can live with, but it most likely screws anyone who is not German or British.4)  You are fundamentally misunderstanding my argument.  I am not saying that countries can work together without rules being forced upon them.  I am saying that I'm pretty sure that countries CANNOT work together in the way that the EU has allowed them to.  The EU does not force laws from one nation upon another, it establishes laws that all members accept.  There is a major difference there, in that the Germans can't simply force the Italians to adopt a German law.I think the problem here is that you (and a lot of the people who voted for Brexit) want what is essentially just a free trade zone across Europe.  A European version of the NAFTA.

Planned incredibly poor [article](http://goo.gl/ul5u9h) by the politicians, mostly supported by the inward looking [article](https://goo.gl/1so5lZ) older generations [article](https://goo.gl/UaWw0H) and those who get their 'information' from Daily Mail / The Sun (which literally can be considered toilet paper in comparison to the likes of The Guardian, Washington Post, The New York Times, Reuters and others), the results turned out to be not what brexiters thought it would be despite countless warnings from various camps, countries and specialists.I feel sad people voted with their heart (under the influence of sophims like [Reductio ad Hitlerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum) and other unverified BS) instead of their heads. I feel it's a defeat for the Europe most of us wanted and looked forward to participate to. It certainly feels like a slap given to those countries that needed strong reforms and radical changes in order to fit the bill and get accepted in the bloc - changes that were demanded by the UK and the others at the time (and I'm not complaining, merely pointing out the effort) - that now watch with mixed feelings how UK fucked itself from the 5th largest economy to the 6th one in a matter of hours. But politics is a game of the heart and not one of the brain. It's not the one who's right that wins campaigns, it's the one that manages to convince the electorate he or she is right. I personally thought Farage is a complete joke; a dangerous one, but still a joke. Now millions of people voted in the light of that joke.It's a step back from all perspectives. Whether it will have positive consequences in time is a matter of how well it'll play its remaining cards now, but the cost already appears bigger than any envisioned or promised benefits in the long term. EU is now weaker but it can become stronger if it can finally get it together and learn some lessons that it should've known by now anyway. The UK has always been the whiny dude in the gang, maybe now EU can get to work with a clearer vision. It's not fair to be nasty with the brits but my feelings are as strong and mixed as they could be. On the one hand I wish they'd really suffer the direst consequences of their ignorant and hasty decision and on the other hand I really feel for them and I know how easy it is to fall for the BS in the media and what a fragile entity a democracy is and how facile is to create disbalance and fear when its guardians are nothing more than toilet paper.First of all, the brexit result should shake the complacent vision of democracy that we've created for ourselves. This referendum was the victory of the greatest modern enemy of the democracy, the [populism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism). It should be a warning to democratic countries everywhere that the country with the most impressive democratic CV just voted itself 10 years into the past, a entirely stupid decision that doesn't make any sense economically, politically or otherwise. In a way, this could be interpreted as a confirmation that masses cannot be trusted to decide their own fate as they'd fuck up too badly. But we know it's not that simple. And we know we need quality impartial journalism instead of toilet paper.The EU should've addressed this undermining of its principles and purpose that started 15 years ago in the UK and other European countries a long time ago. I guess everybody learned something now.The fact that google mentioned that there was an impressive surge of searches for ""what is brexit"" shows just how ignorant most brexit voters were and how little they understood the value of their action and the role of the UK in Europe.I feel like slapping the shit out of the brits.

I am all in favor of working together and to a very high degree in fact. Simply not by the system the EU uses. Because the EU system is about the worse system you can get when your goal is work work together in Europe.1: â€œthe EU would collapse BEFORE it could give the UK a good deal, since the moment that people know that leaving the EU would result in a good deal the entire thing will fall apart. â€œ Oke, I will go in with you on this one.. But of course this also shows that the EU is the worse possible system. As that means that all those countries are now using a system they do not prefer. So let the EU fall apart and set something up that works for anybody. Still like I said before, this is really a lose lose scenario for the EU. Giving them a good deal will show people it can work (better) without the EU and so more people want to leave the EU. If they give them a bad deal it will hurt the EU and show that the EU is not about just working togther also turning more people against the EU.â€œThere are only two path that EU can reasonably take here.â€ Just for the record, with reasonably you main in their best interest, and with their, I mean so the leaders of the EU can still continue with their vision of the EU. Because giving the UK a good deal is very reasonable, but would indeed be a problem for the EU.About your two solutions. 1 could work but is likely not acceptable for the UK, and the second the EU can not take as it's even more economical problems and it shows even more how much the EU is focused on forcing rules upon countries. So while economically they would on paper be able to take it, the dislike towars the EU would grow more having more countries leaving. And don't forget, every country to leave will get is easier because they can make their own agreements with more countries.2: Again, that then only shows what is wrong with the EU. There is another way, a way that many countries wants but the EU refuses to take.3: â€œIf every country can apply their own rules then there is no single market. Free movement of capital, labour, and goods will all be restricted based on the rules of each country.â€ That is partly true. But the thing is that if it comes to trade I think by far most countries are able to come to mutual agreements. Maybe one country has different rules, but most could be able to agree on most things. So it maybe would not be a completely single market, but still something close to it. Semi-single market.The thing is that how much you might like or dislike it, the countries in Europe are very different from each other. Different cultures, different politics, different idea's. That means that if you want to make one big state of it (USE) what the EU has been working towards, there will always be countries disagreeing. And the more rules, the more countries disagree about more things. This results in 2 things... Not being able to make any decisions or unhappy countries. Does this sound familiar to you? This is exactly what you do see now in the EU.I understand that on paper the EU seems fine, and when you look to the USA you would think it's possible. But in reality that is simply not the case. That is exactly why the EU has been failing with so many things and why so many people are starting to dislike the EU, so much that a country just voted to leave the EU.So why 'my solution' might have it's difuculties and might not be a true one open market, it's still the best to implement in Europe.4 â€œThe EU does not force laws from one nation upon another, it establishes laws that all members accept.â€ Even that is not completely true. First of all, now all laws being made in the EU have to be unanimously approved by all countries. Some do, some don't. This means that countries can in fact force laws upon other countries. Secondly there are also agreements where power has literally been giving away by a nation to the EU to make rules for them. An example of that was with the EU constitution that was dumbed Lisbon treaty. Lets first remember that some country's had a referendum and voted against it, but Pro-EU parliaments accepted it anyway.Part of that treaty gives away the rights to make trade agreements. The EU makes them for countries and the countries have to accept them.But likely the biggest problem is the inability to change your mind. This is an essential element of democracy and why you can vote every few years. But in the EU accepting a law is easy, getting rid of it is much harder. The method results in more and more power going to the EU. One you have a parliament that accepts an EU law you can almost not get rid of it anymore. Completely destroying that party (by not voting on them the next time you have that opportunity) and voting for a party that is completely against that law is not going to help you even a little bid. The only way you can then still do is leave the EU.What I want does not have a name as it's not being used anywhere yet. It;s also not strange that we need something 'special' because Europe is kinda special. So many different countries and cultures so close together. I think you don't see that anywhere else on the world.",d4q3b2a,d4pxava,4q0ei6,0.999999999,0.999999998,Brexit,27-06-16

I'm Indian, and if you asked me exactly how many states and 'Union Territories' there are in India, I wouldn't know.  Because the frigging thing keeps changing often.  However, that has zero effect on my understanding of fundamental issues dogging the Republic of India.Democracy is about everyone... and that means *everyone* banding together and making it work.  What makes you think you being better educated or more informed about certain political affairs makes you better placed to make decisions for somebody else.  That is as absurd as somebody claiming that he is better than you because he can run faster than you or jump higher or paint better or simply better than you at calculus.Your arrogance simply blinds you to the real nature of what a democracy ought to be.  Well, I could give several reasons, but didn't because that was not what this conversation was about.  Anyway, EU is a bad idea because forcibly banding diverse peoples under one flag and treasury is never a good idea.  Practically every revolt and uprising in history is the story of somebody chewing off more than they can swallow - which is what the EU has been doing increasingly for decades now.  Also, the proof of the pudding is in the eating.  EU has demonstrably failed as in the socio-economic health of practically every single one of the member nations has worsened over the decades under the EU.  It is only a matter of time before EU countries become like India - a complete basket case of a banana republic where hundreds of millions starve even in 2016 simply because the bureaucracy has grown so big, so ossified and so removed from reality that India is still grappling with problems like sewage and garbage in 2016 - problems that the west solved 100 years ago.

5908,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œMy second proposal would actually work fine for the EU. The loss of the UK from the single market is bad but nowhere near fatal â€ Economically you are right.. I also said so. However the hit the economy will take is not going to help to get people in favor of the EU, and the EU treating the UK bad is also not going to get people on the side of the EU.And that is why it does not work for the EU, in a similar was as you said giving the UK a really good deal would not work. Both will result it more countries wanting to leave the EU. One because they see it can work without the EU, and the other because people get another financial hit and see how the EU treats the UK meaning the â€œIt's about working togetherâ€ argument can also not be used again.â€œThey like the single market and the ability for British people to work anywhere in the EU, but they don't like having EU citizens coming to the UK.â€ Partly true. I think it depends on what countries. And that is exactly the thing. If countries could make agreements with each other, countries could allow citizens coming and going from specific countries, but not from other countries. Within the EU that is not an option. In fact, many countries do not want Turkey in the EU because of this.  So if anything, it's counter productive. But that is not â€œwant their cake and eat it toâ€ I am sure the UK would be just fine making such agreements with the Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and many many other countries in (and outside of) Europe. And then indeed both ways. So having UK citizens going there and having citizens from those countries going to the UK. In addition they also want the ability to get out of such a deal if the voters in their country change their mind about it. Because that is part of democracy.So no, it's not really having the cake and eating it to. There is a big difference. â€œUnderstandably no other member state in the EU would find this acceptable.â€ Understandably most other countries would be fine with what I said. I am 100% sure that Germany or The Netherlands would be willing to come to such an agreement with the UK. They would not be fine with the way you explained it, but that's not what I was suggesting.The big problem with the EU is that it has to be there for all EU countries and that it has to go by the EU rules. While the UK and Germany would else be able to make their own agreement about it. For example, based on how they subsidize studies, they could maybe agree that the country that gets the students pays, or that the country where the student comes from pays, or that the student himself has to pay. It makes sense to have separate rules about this, because different countries also handle this different in their country. But of course the EU has to come up with some sort of overall rules for these types of problems (not specific this one) that sort of fits anybody, but really fits nobody.â€œit is not a case of the EU forcing rules upon the UKâ€ Yes, this is then forcing one rule or policy onto a country. Germany is not allowed to make specific rules about these type of things, like trade, that fit the two countries (Germany, and whatever country it trades with) best. They have to follow the EU law about it.â€œÂ it's rather a case of the UK deciding that they hate (insert European country population here) more than they want to be able to live and work in Europe. â€ False, it's what I just said.. They want to be able to make their own rules. And of course they can still not do so with EU member states because those nations still have to use the EU rules, so the UK will need to make a deal with the EU, not the nations from the EU. But at least they now have the freedom to make such agreements with other non-EU countries and are also released from many other EU regulations that the EU nations have to use.Because I can not imagine the UK would accept a treaty where they implement the EU law, like some countries do. It's not about hating the hating people from the EU. Nonsense.â€œSo what exactly is your proposal in all this? I've outlined my arguments against tearing up the EU â€ Let me be clear, my goal would not be to tear apart the EU. The problem is that I don't believe the EU can still make the necessary changed that are needed. So that makes that we are required to leave the EU behind.What I would want is simply nation states that work together intensively with each other, and that can be on every subject. But no central governmental. What the EU is now, would be reduced to one building where countries can come together on mutual grounds to talk about agreements. Also the agreements are always voluntarily, meaning that if one country comes with an idea, countries can join or not join. They are not required to all join (or all not join). So it's possible that some treaties are only between 5 countries in Europe while other are with them all, or some countries have different variations of the treaties. Secondly they are permissive, meaning a country can change their mind on a later time.This has it's own difficulties, bud is imho the only system that would work for Europe and would allow for true democracy in the nation states.On the notion of different currency. When you are separate countries you can indeed not have a Monetary Union. However that does not mean you can not have a currency that all countries (who want to join in) accept as payment. In fact it would be similar to how Switzerland and the UK still have their own currency but you can pay in many shops with the Euro.So basically every country would have it's own currency (at least on paper, and on your bank account) but you accept a European currency. If you would look on your bank account you would see your money in your own currency and it with the European currency, where the European currency will change on a regular base, based on ithe currency rates.â€œYou say that's not a problem and you are correct, â€ I did not say your vision was not a problem. I said what I suggested would not be a problem. But that is not the same as what you put down there.",d4qascr,d4q4r66,4q0ei6,0.999999719,0.999999437,Brexit,27-06-16
5909,2,CrEaToXx,"German here having a long time sympathy for the Brits, but...you blew it. That basically sums it up slovenly. In that regard focusing on the english and walish citizens only. How do I feel as European citizen being born and raised into a great idea that you've torpedoed? It's treason then, what else would I feel? Do I have the right to be upset towards those that voted remain and addition to the mindless zombies that voted for leave? Sure I have, you haven't fought well enough to prevent this idiocity. And you naivly went to an election to play it like a childs game, for a decision which's outcome may affect you and other countrys for decades in a negative way? And to the older Brits! Generation post-war hypocrites, that lived a social dream as long as the comfort was given to do so, but in the moment it gets tough, you strike your socialist sails and vote for right wing populists, because you feel immigrants took your jobs away you didn't even lifted a finger for? How much of the welfare in your country was caused by the EU during the last 43 years? Ever thought about it? Do you even use your brain to think at all? How dumb and fickle are you? Or is it just because you can't deal the fact your glory and honor from past history has been reduced to rubble, and now two of your biggest competitors have outmatched you in every regard? Please don't tell me it's greed. Because this does not display the UK, nor does it display the EU, it just displays an old and greedy mind setup that even we Germans managed to leave behind us...and that means something!Just a week ago I've seen Britain as one, if not, the most well educated country in Europe: I had the highest respect to your intelligent, rational and exemplary attitude, but now, I'm just baffled at the amount of stupidity displayed by at least 50% of your citizens. Even if you're a undereducated loser, you should have gained knowledge about second world war and the course that Nazis took? Their path was pure destruction and what exactly do right wing populists stand for? Any idea? They want to destroy your multi lateral societys, they want to ruin unity, because they want to force people into believing something that is pure political dynamite, and you don't even fucking get it. You can even sum it down to personal attitude and believes: their life sucks, and so they want to make other peoples life suck as well. Or do you really think that a guy with Nigel Farage or Johnsons gesture and facial expression are happy people? You never learned the basics of body language? What does it fucking tell you gullible chavs? They just want to drag you down to their level, because they felt like they never managed to stay on par with normal people. Are you already at that level? Are you a good person or not British Gentleman?Right wing populists don't push the immigrants away, give you more jobs or make political systems less bureaucratic, their goal is just to isolate you from the rest of the world, because they stand for old fashioned thinking patterns that do not applie to modern societys...and to young societys in that regard. We do not want to be regionally isolated anymore, we want to be part of a bigger idea named world population. You've raised Patrick Steward, the utopian idea of Star Trek anyone? How the fuck can you commit treason on Jean Luc Picard? We see globalization as a chance, as a gift for the whole humanity to achieve what every normal human wants in the bottom of his heart: the right to pursuit happiness and welfare at no one elses cost. And what exactly was it that 50% of your idiotic, egoistic citizens voted for? Right, the pursuit for hapiness on anybody elses cost. Assholes! Is it a long and hard way to achieve this noble goal? Sure it is and I personally felt it the last 10 years, as I was rocketing my life from 0 on par with a high standard middle class person. Did EU hindered or promoted my stance in society? No, they didn't, it was me all the way simply because I felt like I should finally evolve the will and strength to pull myself out of the bog of misery I talked myself into. And even then I did not carried around that amount of xenophobic, undereducated and pessimistic attitude that a big chunk of your citizens did.Yes, we want you out, and we want you out as quickly as possible. I personally want to smack a British person into his face, but there's a 50% chance I'm going to hit the one that doesn't deserve my rage, so from a rational pov this might be a bad idea. However, there's another lesson from history I've learned. After time all the destructors will get what they deserve, it doesn't matter which ethnicity they're from, doesn't matter which religion they believe in, doesn't matter which political system they vote for. The amount of people that don't want their good life destroyed by a bunch of haters are always the majority, and woe to those that overdraw the bow and try to undermine society as a whole, we're always on guard, we're always watching. We come for you if ruin what we've build with blood, sweat and tears. God damn it, even that was a catchphrase labeled by one of your most knowen citizens. Can't you remember? You will be given enough chances to return in peace and harmony in the next copple of days, I'm certain, so don't blew it again! You already caused enough damage to yourself and others, don't make us come for you...-.-Some hard facts for the blinded people. 1. politics are real, recognize the difference to unreal and metaphysic notions and ideals? Tell me if so, because then you've reached the level of understanding on how religions work. And religions are not politics you bollocks! 2. voted to no longer pay to high taxes to the EU? You've payed less then 130 billion â‚¬ in the last 43 years to the EU, but managed to destroy more then 4 times the amount of money in less then 5 days due to your Brexit vote. It's a disgrace, that you still have the courage to seriously argue anything regarding this disaster.  3. you feel like the EU is a silly and overly bureaucratic monster? Well, that's true for almost any person in any country around the world, but most people do understand that unity is far better then any individuality when it comes down to economical, educational and social questions. Our strongest ability is to function as individual in a large group of people, humans work like that at least the last 500.000 years. Isolation is exactly the opposition of what actually is good to your health, prosperity and happiness. The larger a cooperating group, the larger the benefit for anyone. Simple calculation?

Because the only reason the EU would be able to force the UK into a bad deal, is because it has many member states. But that power will go away when the member states leave. And while many people clearly think, those people in favor of leaving are stupid, they really are not.Nonetheless, There are still many EU member states that wants to give the UK a good deal and even better, I already did see the first 'anti-EU' parties debate talk about how the EU should make a good deal with the UK and not a bad one simply to punish them. That is important because it brings this to the attention of the people. Meaning the EU can give the UK a good deal, but then fall apart because it turns out that all those doom scenario's where false and the UK is doing even better, Or they give it a bad deal, but then all the people will also notice and have that as reason for leaving the EU.Also please note that Belgium is one of the more pro-EU countries at this stage.

Nonetheless, it shows what more and more people are starting to dislike what the EU has become.I also find it strange that Belgium is in fact so pro EU.

5928,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œThere is representative and direct democracy you know?Â  â€ I know, both allow you to change your mind. And representative seems to have it's flaws. Like politicians promising this during campaign but then doing something else when they are in power. A mix of the two would be best imho.â€œThe bigger the governed population is, the less sense do referendums/plebescites make. Unless you have no goverment.â€ Why? It works just fine. The fact that it did not work out for the EU so well, does not mean referendums don't work.. in fact it might proof that they work. â€œWhat exactly do Switzerland and Norway do for the poorer countries in east- and south europe? CLOSE TO NOTHING. â€ What has this to do with anything.. Or do you want to dorce such things upon countries. Then I can completely understand why you are in favor of the EU. The EU will force many rules upon countries, but while you might think this is a good idea, many people clearly don't. That is why we had the Brexit.â€œAnd if you think the most things in Switzeland are decided by referendums you are lunatic fool and should start to inform your self. You make yourself a clown right now. â€ Well I did not really say that correctly there, you got me. They do not decide everything with referendums but are able to have referendums about almost everything.I do not know the exact rules. But if there is a law you disagree on, or if you want to propose a law, you can get people to back you on that, and if you have enough people you can get a referendum about the subject.â€œThat you are your sister and some friends agree, does not yet make it the consensus of the people.â€â€œYou have f_cking no clue how modern economies and societies run. â€ Oow I do, â€œTHE PEOPLE CANT DECIDE WHATS RIGHT IN GEOPOLOITICAL AND MACROECONOMICAL QUESTIONS! â€ No that is the problem. â€œThe lack the insight, experise and deeper knowledge.â€ Sure, if you dislike democracy this would be a good argument. Say people are to stupid and put some experts on place to decide it for them. Luckily that has never gone wrong... ah wait, did they not do something like that in the EU, resulting in many problems and now a country leaving. Of course many dictators also know what is bet for the people. Maybe you should try NK, they also have a leader that who knows what is best for you.No seriously, Democracy might have it flaws, but putting a few people in charge is crazy and dangerous.â€œAlso they tend do be more and more vulnerable to main stream media and scare tactics. â€ Really? I had the idea the media was losing power over the people,.. partly thanks to the power of the Internet. Lets look at the Brexit, where the media was mainly for remain and people got scared into voting Brexit. However, as we have seen, they voted for a Brexit anyway.â€œBUT IF THE MOST EXPERTS AGREE TO ONE SIDE, THERE MUST BE A POINT FFS! â€ They where wrong about so many things. From the idea that the earth was the center of the Universe to implementation of the Euro, that resulted in a Euro-crisis. (well they did foresee the Euro-crisis but did not foresee that the people would still not bow for their USE. So sadly sience does not work by the rules of democracy, The identification majority (if it even is the majority? Maybe the media just shows one opinion more) is not always correct. It is a little, like how some people that typing in caps makes them right. But of course that does also not work that way.â€œSwitzeland is a small isolationist country with close to none real economy.â€ It's not isolated, it's the 19th economy of the world and it is rich.. Ah and their banks.. That they respect the privacy of the people is a good thing. â€œAnd they will fail hardâ€ If you wait long enough, maybe someday. But for now they are doing very well, like I said it's one of the riches country in the EU.â€œAlso many norwegian politicians claimed multiple times that norway would be f_cked economically without their fossil resources and waterpower. â€ That I do believe. Socialist. â€œPlease get som actual and deeper knowlegde and read some experts. You are the same pseudo-informed morons that pushed for brexit. â€ That is funny, because you use the same rhetoric that the peo-EU side used and got people to vote for Brexit. You know, like how people should not have a vote because of a lack of insights. ",d4qd7lp,d4q81s7,4q00mb,0.999933822,0.999867645,Brexit,27-06-16

5960,2,-Crnogorac-,"Post Brexit predictions As the title stands, this thread is dedicated to post Brexit predictions, so here's mine : Scotland is already preparing to leave, and this time they will have an easy win on independence referendum. The main reason they stayed in UK, was because they wanted to remain a part of EU. Now that that's gone out of the window, there isn't a common goal that ties them to UK.After Scotland, N. Ireland will follow. If Scotland gains independence (which they almost certainly will), it will only strengthen their separatist desires, and give them a green light to leave as well.To make matters worse, on top of this deepening political crisis, which UK is currently in, there's an economic one in sight. As soon as the EU trade agreements end, which they will, they will lose the privileged, tax free position. There won't be a Norway-like free trade model, as that would give other EU members an incentive to leave. Therefore, EU will make an example out of UK, to prevent others from making the same move.Loss of free trade agreements will in turn make products made in UK less desirable, and much harder to sell to buyers in EU, as they would suddenly become more expensive. In order to combat this, they'd have to greatly cut into their margins, thereby lowering the profit.To make matters worse, the instability caused by political crisis, and the practically unavoidable recession will ensue a capital flight. Since UK's economy isn't mostly production based(industry and agriculture), but service based (nearly 80% of GDP), this will have an even more devastating effect on the economy!As can be surmised from this post, in my opinion the political crisis, in conjunction with an economic one will prove fatal to UK, and it won't survive, at least not as it is now. It'll take time for it to be fully realized, but it's already set in motion. And since people of UK are as dumb as people of Yugoslavia were, it's highly unlikely to be stopped.Basically, I expect this to unfold like Yugoslavia, the only difference is that there won't be bloodshed.",NA,NA,4q0i1y,3.55E-05,-0.999928937,Against,27-06-16

6034,2,Rangtangatang,"Did Cameron actually stop the brexit? If Boris Johnson looked downbeat yesterday, that is because he realises that he has lost.Perhaps many Brexiters do not realise it yet, but they have actually lost, and it is all down to one man: David Cameron.With one fell swoop yesterday at 9:15 am, Cameron effectively annulled the referendum result, and simultaneously destroyed the political careers of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and leading Brexiters who cost him so much anguish, not to mention his premiership.How?Throughout the campaign, Cameron had repeatedly said that a vote for leave would lead to triggering Article 50 straight away. Whether implicitly or explicitly, the image was clear: he would be giving that notice under Article 50 the morning after a vote to leave. Whether that was scaremongering or not is a bit moot now but, in the midst of the sentimental nautical references of his speech yesterday, he quietly abandoned that position and handed the responsibility over to his successor.And as the day wore on, the enormity of that step started to sink in: the markets, Sterling, Scotland, the Irish border, the Gibraltar border, the frontier at Calais, the need to continue compliance with all EU regulations for a free market, re-issuing passports, Brits abroad, EU citizens in Britain, the mountain of legislation to be torn up and rewritten ... the list grew and grew.The referendum result is not binding. It is advisory. Parliament is not bound to commit itself in that same direction.The Conservative party election that Cameron triggered will now have one question looming over it: will you, if elected as party leader, trigger the notice under Article 50?Who will want to have the responsibility of all those ramifications and consequences on his/her head and shoulders?Boris Johnson knew this yesterday, when he emerged subdued from his home and was even more subdued at the press conference. He has been out-manoeuvred and check-mated.If he runs for leadership of the party, and then fails to follow through on triggering Article 50, then he is finished. If he does not run and effectively abandons the field, then he is finished. If he runs, wins and pulls the UK out of the EU, then it will all be over - Scotland will break away, there will be upheaval in Ireland, a recession ... broken trade agreements. Then he is also finished. Boris Johnson knows all of this. When he acts like the dumb blond it is just that: an act.The Brexit leaders now have a result that they cannot use. For them, leadership of the Tory party has become a poison chalice.When Boris Johnson said there was no need to trigger Article 50 straight away, what he really meant to say was ""never"". When Michael Gove went on and on about ""informal negotiations"" ... why? why not the formal ones straight away? ... he also meant not triggering the formal departure. They both know what a formal demarche would mean: an irreversible step that neither of them is prepared to take.All that remains is for someone to have the guts to stand up and say that Brexit is unachievable in reality without an enormous amount of pain and destruction, that cannot be borne. And David Cameron has put the onus of making that statement on the heads of the people who led the Brexit campaign.Source: in the comments section http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/25/brexit-live-emergency-meetings-eu-uk-leave-vote#comment-77205935",NA,NA,4q5e0q,2.37E-14,-1,Against,27-06-16

I have heard today that there's a 75% chance that Toyota, Nissan and Honda will leave as there is a 10% tariff on imports from outside the EU. The City of London contributed 194 Billion to the economy in 2014, and that may be locked out due to ""passporting"" restrictions (the rights to sell into the EU), a new survey by the Confederation of British Industry shows 20% of respondents have implemented a hiring freeze, and this is in addition to the headline news about the dollar falling. Boris was not in Parliament today to hear and debate about a statement David Cameron made, chose to play Cricket on Saturday, see family on Sunday, and come out with a column in the Daily Telegraph that has been ripped to shreds as half truths and garbage by the Indy100 online website.

Inter-caste marriages are dime a dozen and people from the lowest castes have been MPs, Ministers, Chief Ministers, Prime Ministers and Presidents for decades now.  hell, even your friend sitting there and sipping scotch might be from one of the lower castes!and talking of caste politics, that is another shining example of how being part of the Indian Union fucks up my state (Karnataka) for no reason.  My state traditionally has been less anal about caste compared to several other states in India.  However, we have to share the burden of all the caste politics from far off states that we never had anything to do with, but informs national policy around everything.""couple""?  you kidding me?  affirmative action programs (and I support the idea, for the record) are a way of life in India.  barring the private sector jobs, there is no sphere of Indian life that affirmative action has not touched.  and I personally, as one of the so-called 'Forward Castes' have been at the receiving end of it, if anything.  you seriously need to stop drinking the bloody kool-aid your friend is feeding you.  the bugger probably has blood on his hands.if the EU could be less discriminatory and would let poor immigrants from all around the world into their cities (instead of being parochial and allow only 'Europeans'), I can personally guarantee no less than 400 million immigrants willing to move from India to Britain.  like, right now.",d4qfzhq,d4qfdy5,4q3skk,0.97710805,0.954216099,Brexit,28-06-16

6062,2,pingieking,"Everything you've said here is the same problem that I've had with most of the Leave side's proposals; they are very hand-wavey and entirely unrealistic.  Let's run through my objections.1)  A single market will not be able to exist without free movement of labour.  It creates too much economic imbalance to work.  The immigration issue is also not something that can be solved between countries.  The single currency of the Euro also can't exist without some sort of central political union and central bank to control it.  What could be done is apply the domination of the most powerful currency across the trade zone.  So perhaps everyone in the zone would have to accept the Deutchmarks or the Pound as a common currency.  However, since neither Germany nor the UK has the kind of economic dominance that the US does, this won't be possible without significant coercion.2)  What you've described is essentially a gathering place where government officials can exchange ideas.  Sure, it'll work, but there's next to no chance that it'll generate the kind of cooperation that you're describing.  Mostly due to the next three points:3)  The entire concept of permissive treaties is unworkable.  There is no way that anyone would take seriously an agreement that a country would be able to pull out of at any time for any reason.  If I am running a multinational company, why should I invest a significant amount of money into a country when I know that the voters there can wake up the next day and pull out of the very treaty that caused me to invest there in the first place?  International treaties and agreements are legally binding and they are usually complicated to get out of for that very reason.  An agreement that a country can basically just decide to get out of on a whim is the same as having no agreement.5)  I have revisit the issue of migration because we disagree so fundamentally from this.  The free movement of people across borders is just about impossible without the kind of political union that the EU has.  There is a reason why open borders like the Schengen area are incredibly rare (the only examples that I can think of are Ireland v Northern Ireland and Australia and New Zealand); it's because they are ridiculously difficult to negotiate due to economic and social imbalances.  The realistic outcome is that if the common market breaks down every country would return to the usual work visa/permit system.  It's not the end of the world, but there are pretty severe social and economic consequences for that.  These consequences are going to involve involuntary resettlement and deportations, likely splitting of families and a lot of lawyers making a lot of money.  You suggested the idea that Germany and the UK could come to an agreement about free movement of people, and I just have to reject that notion.  Not even Canada and the US has that, and they are more culturally and economically integrated than any two European nation could ever be.  I happen to think that the free movement of people through Europe is a good thing.  You can disagree, and you are perfectly justified in thinking so.  However, simply suggesting that two countries can negotiate something like this is getting very close to magical thinking.6)  You are doing a bit of the ""have my cake and eat it too"" mentality as well.  The fundamental issue is that national sovereignty and international agreements are mutually exclusive because an international agreement is an act of giving up some sovereignty in exchange of some benefit, whether economic or military or otherwise.  The more agreements a country signs, the less sovereign control it has over its own affairs.  If you want to push for more democratic control you are essentially pushing for less international cooperation.  It's fine if that's your position (there's nothing inherently wrong with less global integration), but you have to recognize that it's your position.  I happen to think that more cooperation is better, but that's based more on faith than facts.So in conclusion, I think that your proposal would work but it would essentially look identical to pre-EU Europe.  My position is that the EU is the least bad system out of a list of bad systems.  The reason that the EU was created was because pre-EU Europe was not working very well, so I don't see why it would work better this time.

It already has in place four different trading models with other countries, two of which do not involve Freedom of Movement: the Turkey option (European Customs Union) and the Canada option (trade agreement).It is entirely possible that a unique free trade agreement could be negotiated without Freedom of Movement in exchange for a greater monetary contribution. This contribution would end up being higher than what the UK is contributing today, though. And isn't that one of the things that the Leave movement complained about (i.e. the 350 million pounds from the bus)?It seems unlikely however that there would be a unilateral Freedom of Movement accord, though. That is, any restriction on Freedom of Movement in the UK by EU nationals would also imply restriction of movement for British nationals in the EU countries (there are 1.2 million British nationals living in the EU today benefiting from the current agreement).Access to the Single Market would also require compliance with all the European directives whose purpose in the first place is to ensure consistency of regulations (i.e. no 100 Watt light bulb, regulations on pillow cases, etc...).For many years, the UK has been given by the EU a lot of flexibility (staying out of Schengen, staying out of the Euro zone, discounted contribution, and many more including the latest agreement that Cameron got in February).

If countries can make their own laws they can decide how to tackle the crisis. For example. Some countries might not want to accept people into their countries but are willing to set up a safe zone in the are where people are fleeing from. The countries who want that can unite and do that. The countries that want to accept people into their country can do that.

Inflation of deflation would also not be a huge deal because every country has it's own real currency.2I guess I have to react to this in the next 3 points.3â€œThere is no way that anyone would take seriously an agreement that a country would be able to pull out of at any time for any reason. â€You it's funny that this is the default reaction to my idea about this. But you do realize that all your national laws are based on the same principles. After a few years you can vote for anther party that removes a law the previous one implemented. Still companies are already investing money into countries while all the law in those countries can change every few year. It does not seem to be a problem here, but somehow you expect it to be a problem with these types of agreements.I disagree, in fact it's the only democratic way, but also the only workable way. You see, in the current version, if I have a party and are at power, I can put a not popular law into action in the EU by singing it. This has happened before (Lisbon Tread for example). So now I have what I want but the problem is that many different cabinets will do this resulting in a lot of EU regulation that is not popular with a lot of people. And if you have unhappy people we know what happens right... brexit.In my solution, I would be forces to think about what treaty I would sign.. Would this be agreeable by other cabinets, would it survive the sands of time. It will result in regulations that has much more people behind it.â€œInternational treaties and agreements are legally binding and they are usually complicated to get out of for that very reason. â€ Yeah I also have a problem with that, as it makes them harder to remove then constitutional law what is crazy and even dangerous for freedoms. But that is another subject. Anyway, in the union I talked about, every treaty would simply have a line saying that you can get out of it. So it does not matter if it's legally binding or not, you can still get out of it..

And you are correct, it's very complicated mainly because of economic and social imbalances. But just as with the first point... You say this would not work in my model, but just as with your example from 1 (immigration) we see that it's also not working as many countries want in the EU. Mainly because the EU it putting many different countries together that are economically and socially imbalanced.If you would be able to make such agreements with countries separated this would not be as big of an issue. You could simply make an agreement with a country that is very close to you, form an economic and social perspective, but do not have an agreement with countries that are very different. And lets say one of those countries makes some use mistakes, throwing themselves in a financial crisis resulting it economic imbalances becoming a problem, you can end the treaty at least for the time being. It's really a much more stable system as the EU because the EU tries to fit everything in one box, but it does not fit.â€œYou suggested the idea that Germany and the UK could come to an agreement about free movement of people, and I just have to reject that notion.â€ Well you can reject that, I am sure it can work.â€œI happen to think that the free movement of people through Europe is a good thing. You can disagree, and you are perfectly justified in thinking so. â€ I do not say I disagree. I think it's positive, but it also has it's problems. Like you said, two European countries are very different from each other, more different then Canada and the US and they don't have an arrangement like this because they are so different. That shows hoe problematic it can be and the EU is not some magic solution for it. One country can now start to give out passports to immigrants and then they can freely move to any country, and they all have to accept them. Some might love that idea, other don't. But this sort of things do result in the problems we now have with the EU. Again something that would not happen in my model.â€œHowever, simply suggesting that two countries can negotiate something like this is getting very close to magical thinking. â€ Funny, I just talked about how you seem to think the EU is some sort of magic you use to make it work.6 â€œThe more agreements a country signs, the less sovereign control it has over its own affairs. If you want to push for more democratic control you are essentially pushing for less international cooperation. â€ The problem is that with all your explanations you are thinking inside the current box. Simply the fact that you can get out of a treaty (my model) makes you can have treaties and be democratic anyway. That btw does not mean you are getting rid of treaties all the time. But as we see with the Brexit, if you can not get rid of them, at some point people want to get out the system as a whole. And lets say my and your country would sign a treaty that we don't raise import duties, and then I do it with another country, and another one and another one. In what way am I giving away sovereign control. I am not.â€œThe reason that the EU was created was because pre-EU Europe was not working very well â€ You are talking about the EEC?

The decrease in confidence in UK markets are going to lead to a delay of spending on both a foreign and local level until things settle down. I'm not sure how long that will take but it basically means people will want to wait until the government lays out their intentions of what they want to do with this referendum. When theyre going to trigger it, what type of government then want to instill if they do, etc. As for is it going to be harder to get a mortgage? Actually, the Bank of England is going to most likely be lowering interest rates to help try to fight against the economic slowdown. Although the decreasing value of the pound does create inflationary pressures (which would normally lead to tightening/raising interest rates), the BoE will likely be dropping the interest rate from 0.5% currently towards 0%. The 10 Year bond is expected to trade at about 0.7% according to futures. What all this means is your loans might actually be cheaper once the Bank of England steps in. Another interesting this is that the German 10 year note is actually trading at -0.2% right now. This is because people are so afraid in Europe that they're literally willing to pay 0.2% to ensure they have their money in 10 years. (Germany is considered the most economically ""solid"" EU country atm). This is expected to converge towards 0 near year end once things stabalize. edit: I read your reply again.

6109,2,ahbugdayci,"American here*. Unlike the popular opinion here, I think Brexit raised very legitimate concerns.Firstly EU is not a democracy. It most certainly is exploited by heavier economies (where UK was ironically one of). Bigger economies who control ECB and Brussels have been deciding for the greater Europe area for quite a while now. Greek bailouts are one of the best examples for this. It was German and French banking system that extended all that loans knowing they would default. Why? Because why not, eventually common-folk and taxpayers would pay for their mistake. British were already pissed about that. They were simply paying for this mistake, even though their banks didn't loan a dime due to risk of default.Another good example is how the trading with Euro helps big economies that are export based. Thanks to EU and Euro Germany expanded it's exports many-folds, yet for new EU countries who import more than export this is poisonous. Now, would Brexit help UK in the short run? I do not think so. Does it make the country more flexible with it's trading and political decision making in the long run? Most certainly it will. Economies shake once in a while. Brexit news indeed hit the UK economy, but that doesn't mean this impact will be permanent. I thin Europe wants to scare it's members to prevent them from following UK's footsteps and they are using ""economic instability"" argument for their agenda.* Not a mainland European so I do not fit the description, but can give my impression after talking to many friends from mainland Europe (Germany, France, Switzerland etc) and some non-European friends (Turkish, Russian).",d4qkr7d,4q2lsb,4q2lsb,0.443500421,-0.112999158,Neutral,28-06-16

6112,2,pingieking,"I'm going to respond using your numbering system.1)  I would actually argue that the EU's Schengen area is the most successful open border system in history.  I think it's hard to argue against the kind of social and economic opportunities it has brought to people of all countries inside the EU.  Racism and social friction caused by immigrants will always be a thing, but I would say that the Schengen area has been incredible successful.3)  National laws can be based on the same principal because it only affects the people making the decisions.  Also, do you have any idea how difficult it is to change a law within a country?  It usually takes years of political battles, and most of the time it doesn't directly affect other nations.  This is why it's a massive deal anytime someone breaks or backs out of an international treaty.  If something like the NAFTA can be undone or renegotiated simply by a change of power in Canada's parliament, the treaty wouldn't be worth the paper its written on.  What you are proposing is essentially giving the people of a country the ability to fuck over the people in another country for any reason at any time (I can sign the deal if it looks beneficial to me and then pull out of it the moment it isn't, even if it hurts the other party).  Sure, you can do it, but international agreements are based on trust and credibility, and once you pull something like that once it's going to be hard to convince anyone else to work with you again.  This is wishful thinking at work.5)  I think the EU's model for immigration has not been perfect, but a hell of a lot better than any other model that has been conceived or tried.  The EU tries to deal with the social and economic imbalances by tying everyone together in a single market, therefore leveling the differences a little bit.  It's not perfect, but I think it's doing decently well.  You disagree, and thinks that individual nations can negotiate something different.  We won't reach any agreement on this one.  I just have to say that history shows how difficult this one is, and that the idea of individual countries negotiating them among themselves is wishful thinking (just look at how few open borders there are in the world outside the Schengen area).  If the US and Canada can't get it done, then the chances of any substantial open border in Europe without the coercive forces of the EU is minimal at best.By the way, your model would essentially involve either deporting all foreigners out of all the EU countries or giving them some kind of special status allowing them to stay indefinitely while not allowing any new arrivals.  It would basically be the visa system for every country.  It'll work fine, it just won't be and open border.6)  I consider the EEC to be essentially the first form of the EU, so no I didn't mean the EEC.  I actually meant Europe before that, from the end of the Roman Empire to WWII.  I understand that your model asks for much more cooperation between countries, but that's precisely where it fails the most.  People will only cooperate when it benefits them somehow and the moment it doesn't they will look for a way out.  The entire point of an international treaty is to prevent the countries from backing out of an agreement even if it doesn't immediately benefit them.  If you allow any country to exit a treaty at any time for any reason then there is effectively no treaty.  Why should country A trust country B when they know that country B can scrap the treaty the moment it doesn't benefit them?For example, lets say I'm Canada and I've negotiated a trade deal with Iceland.  I tell Iceland that I will buy lots of fish from them as long as they conform to my trade rules and allow me to be the only one to import cars into their country.  The cars I import will be cheaper than the international market prices, so this will benefit Iceland as well.  Then two years later I sign another trade deal with the US where I can buy lots of fish from them, and I turn around and scrap the deal with Iceland.  Now Iceland is fucked, because they can't import cheap cars and now have to scramble to sign another trade deal with someone else to get cheap car imports.  This is why international agreements are so hard to get out of; it's because nobody wants to be the one getting screwed and thus wants some legal protection.  This legal protection is going to prevent the other country from leaving the agreement whenever they feel like it.  This is the same reason why legal contracts between individuals usually have very detailed clauses for ending the contracts; it's to prevent one party from fucking the other.This may not be the best example but I'm not smart enough to come up with a better one.I agree that the EU is not perfect, but what you are suggesting with your model of international agreements is naive on the highest order.",d4qkxoz,d4qj77c,4q0ei6,0.998962746,0.997925492,Brexit,28-06-16

My view is that the UK wants all the benefits of being in the EU (mostly due to being in the single market) without any of the costs (using the Euro, accepting immigrants, and so on).  Not feeling like the the UK is helping much.Well that's kind of the thing isn't it?  The EU presented the UK with a choice, and the UK rejected it.  They are free to do so, but they can't expect the EU to bend over backwards for them.I never said don't like them, but I highly doubt that anyone is giving political and economic concessions to the US or Switzerland just because they like them.

If those two things are off the table, what gains do the EU get for letting the UK into the single market?  The answer is not much.

Those MEPs are democratically elected in each country and can be 'kicked out' and replaced by new representatives when their term expires, every five years.So, if you don't like an ""EU official"", you can vote them out, at least as far as MEPs are concerned.The problem is that there are a lot of other officials that make the EU bureaucracy work. Some of them are not elected by direct democracy. For example, the President of the European Council, currently Carl Junker, is elected by the members of the European Council, who in turn are the head of states of the member countries (who are democratically elected). The president of the European Commission (currently Jean-Claude Junker) is elected by the European Parliament (who is democratically elected).

It's just as possible that the people in the UK Googling the EU had voted to Remain or didn't vote at all! Surely, there were uninformed voters (there always are) but it's likely that charge can be leveled against voters of both Leave and Remain.All this is is yet another attempt (and there have been MANY since Friday) to undermine the result of the referendum. You will see Britain, as we did in Ireland, that your clear instruction will be interpreted any way the government wants, and in this case it seems that Jeremy Hunt (who could succeed Cameron as PM) wants to interpret it as a mandate to renegotiate a deal on borders with the EU. Of course, that's not what it is, it provides him with no mandate of any kind, it instructs him to Leave the EU.What should have been a simple instruction, which should have led to a careful and considered exit from the EU within the next few years and an effort to retain some level of open and free trade with the European single market while pursuing other trade deals and to consult with governments of countries that have a lot of citizens living in the UK... is likely instead to become a domestic nightmare where the Tory government will try to negotiate a deal with the EU on immigration, secure some concession, and then put it to a vote again while doubling down on fear-mongering, and it will probably work.The truth is though, it will leave an incredible amount of resentment among MILLIONS of voters who may then be tempted by political parties much further on the fringes because the people will REJECT the establishment.

6213,2,Grrrmachine,"Here are my reasons for supporting a Leave campaign:**1) Fiscal Policy**All EU states are committed to joining the Eurozone at an unspecified point in time, as outlined in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. Only Britain and Denmark have optouts, and Sweden has managed to avoid it by deliberately failing to meet its criteria. However, Italy was able to adopt it without ever meeting the same criteria, Greece was allowed to adopt it (and look how that turned out), while other countries (Poland) simply reject the concept. Either Europe is united in a joint fiscal policy, or it tears itself apart as independent states manipulate their currency rates for their own benefit. And despite all this manouvering, the currency was still irreparably damaged by the Swiss (A NON-EU MEMBER!) when they abandoned their artificial pegging of the Swiss Franc to the Euro. The EU is powerless in this matter, and yet has handed over a key element of its import and export mechanism to people who can abuse it with no repercussions.**2) Budget**The EU agrees its budget in 7-year chunks, and we're currently in the middle of the 2014-2020 budgetary period. 38% of that budget goes to farmers, thanks to France's and Poland's aggressive attitude in voting for the Common Agricultural Policy. As of 2013, the EU contains 12million full-time farmers, so 2.4% of the population receive 38% of its budget - is that a fair distribution of funds? Farming does not provide growth, it does not generate jobs, it does not improve the quality of live in regions and it does not educate the youth, and yet this section of EU spending GROWS every single budget, despite the votes from the countries that contribute the most funds to the EU pot (which includes Britain). In this cycle alone, Poland will receive nearly three times as much as the next recipient (Italy) by 2020. However, by that time Poland must switch to being a net contributor, paying in more than it receives. By using that money simply to subsidise farmers, there is no way on earth that it will promote economic growth, and a generation of youth east of the Berlin Wall are being ignored or abandoned for the principle of home-grown tomatoes. **3) Democracy**The EU has multiple presidents, none of whom you voted for. It is comprised of agencies too numerous to mention. Its laws are drafted by unelected civil servants whose pay and credentials you have no control over, and the MEPs you vote for only have the power to vote against laws, not to create them. In cases of big changes, such as new treaties, the EU has clearly shown its democratic ideals in its bullying of Ireland over the Lisbon treaty; Ireland was the ONLY country in the EU granted a referendum on the treaty - which includes articles on a joint judiciary system, a joint army (""a common defence"", article 42), and removes a number of national vetoes - and was forced to vote again until it got the right answer. This treaty replaces the EU Constitution, which had already been rejected by French and Dutch voters, who were not given a referendum on the new version.**4) Economy**The EU economy, as a proportion of global trade, is shrinking. It has been shrinking year on year. It has been in trouble ever since the 2008 crisis (*that's EIGHT YEARS AGO*). Since then, it has handed over billions of EU taxpayers' money to inefficient states like Greece; it has failed to address youth unemployment in Spain; and it has failed to significantly improve the standard of living in the vast majority of post-2004 ascencion countries (13 of them). It is now a group of 28 member states of various countries with dwindling exports, near-0% interest rates, centered around a weakened currency built on false principles (as evidenced by the PIIGS crisis of 2010). Thanks to the monolithic approach of the EU, there is no clear policy to handle this, other than to try to tax Britain's most profitable industry (banking and finance) to pay for it all. Remember, in 2012 the EU proposed a 'Tobin Tax' that would generate 50bn EUR a year to use as a bailout fund. 25 states voted for this tax. Britain would generate 80% of that tax. Based on who is owed the most money from the PIIGS countries, France and Germany would receive 80% of those funds. That's not a Robin Hood tax; that's a Sherriff of Nottingham tax.**5) In-fighting**France takes an active role in dumping immigrants at Britain's doorstep, hailing right back to the Sangatte camp of the 1990s. It illegally blocked British agricultural exports for decades, with no repercussions. In other regions, Hungary directly opposes the core principles of the EU. Poland is locked in a constitutional crisis, with a government working directly against EU regulations (media neutrality, environmental protection) that the EU is powerless to enforce or correct. Greece elected an anti-austerity government and was overruled by the EU. Morally despicable solutions with Turkey were created to deal with the migrant crisis. Countries close their borders in direct contradiction to the Schengen principles, and states veto the relocation of refugees in a self-interested attempt to avoid the burden of providing food and housing to those in need. Examples like these (and there are many) demonstrate that the EU is not comprised of 28 states working together; it's an immature group of countries that take when it suits them, and give back as little as they can if they can get away with it. It operates more like a cartel than a mature democratic institution.**SUMMARY**The EU is an inefficient behemoth of unwieldy laws and vampiric fiscal policy, steered by nations' self-interests with a complete disregard for the founding principles the populations voted for. It is incapable of reacting to the rapidly-changing global economy or culture, it is powerless to enforce its own regulations, and it ignores the wills of its citizens to enforce the outdated dreams of its architects. This is not the EEC that the UK voted to remain part of in 1975, which was the last time anyone in Britain had any say on the nature of the European Union.The social and economic policies of Britain do not align with the direction the EU is taking, and that is evidenced by the voting records of the UK during its membership and the number of opt-outs it has (only Denmark has more). As the EU continues to push for further integration, further centralization and ever more expansion, the UK will find itself increasingly marginalised and voiceless. For the world's 5th largest economy, that's no logical place to be.",d4qwqyr,4q6bza,4q6bza,1,1,Brexit,28-06-16

6280,2,JamieD86,"I really don't agree that the Brexit camp was the ""only side"" spreading misinformation about the EU. I'm not sure which of the Leave side's public figures actually spread misinformation, maybe you can point me to it? For example though, I did see some on the Remain side try to dismiss the claims of a democratic deficit, but they failed in my opinion to do so. Take the commission for example. You might hear that Jean Claude Juncker is unelected, to which you'll be told about how the European Council and European Parliament are involved in the appointment of the Commission President, and because the Council are all heads of state (or national parliament), and the parliament is directly elected, that makes it a democratic.In fact, it doesn't because it bestows competences and responsibilities on the commission that go way beyond those of a mere regulator. Governments do of course appoint regulators who aren't voted for, but the European Commission is not just a regulatory branch, it's the Executive Body of the EU, so the absence of a popular mandate from any constituency is a problem.. and I'd argue that the President in particular really should require more than just a popular mandate from a constituency, since there are 28 countries and 500 million people.In reality, the way the commission is formed has been subject of controversy from outside and within the EU itself for quite some time. It's ironic that David Cameron wanted the UK to stay in the EU, when he was just one of two on the European Council who opposed Mr Juncker's appointment and admitted he had lost support for his opposition (including Merkel) due to backroom dealing etc. That's simply not how such a figure should be enshrined with legislative power in the EU.So in that sense, that the EU has a democratic deficit is not misinformation, it is true, and the problem is several years ago the EU can be described as transitioning from simply have undemocratic aspects on paper, to being anti-democratic in practice, in how it interfered so intrusively and dangerously in a democratic election in Greece. But ye, that's just an example of how some serious problems with the EU can be written off, but on closed examination they remain problems, and ones that the EU has no appetite to solve.Now as for the reaction to Brexit, well it's not a surprise. The S&amp;P is not a surprise, this is the credit agency that downgraded the United States because it had a huge debate between the executive and congressional branches of government over raising the debt ceiling a few years ago.The pound/sterling can recover its losses in time, but in reality the strength of the GBP was questioned long before Brexit was on the menu, and a slightly weaker currency wouldn't be a terrible outcome in terms of competitiveness.As for the Europe reaction, well I wouldn't worry about that at all. The truth is most European states have no intention of losing trade with Britain, and Britain can take all the time in the world it wants to active Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, it can't be forced to, so any Eurocrat throwing a hissy fit will just have to shut up and wait and to be honest, Britain has been a NET CONTRIBUTOR to the European project for a long time now to the tunes of tens of billions (net) in funding, and in other ways such as the fact that even now, three million people live in the UK who were born in other EU countries, and many more have lived and worked in the EU (provided with economic opportunity) over the years. The fact is Britain has already bloody well paid enough to be treated fairly.The reaction that will prevail will be the initial reaction from Angela Merkel which is to do this right and in the right environment. I wouldn't worry when a bunch of old farts have a meeting and call for Britain to leave quickly, the reality is they are the ones making the EU look bad.Reminds me of Martin Schulz (president of the European parliament) who made some comment about how the philosophy of the EU is that the ""mob"" doesn't get to decide its future. Now think about that... the ""mob"" is how he describes the electorate of a member state which votes to leave.. I wonder what he'd call them if they'd have voted to stay.. but in his words is the admission that eurocrats quite often don't believe that citizens have a right to vote on the EU at all. Similar dismissive comments were made by Mr Juncker after the Dutch and French voted to REJECT the EU Constitution over a decade ago... the EU responded by turning it into the Lisbon Treaty and just not letting them vote on it. Ireland did vote on it, rejected it.. and then were essentially coerced to vote for it again!Where does this all end exactly? Last thing I'll say because I know I've gone on way too much, but the truth is the EU is a far cry from what it should have been. At one time it is true that European institutions and treaties provided a means by which countries on the continent could ease and facilitate trade and commerce, as well as move around more easily, in a way that may have been very difficult otherwise. Now, however, the world has changed and changed rapidly and the truth is that Europe is stagnating, while other parts of the world are growing. World trade has changed a lot even in the past 20 years and the EU is starting to become irrelevant to trade, and worse, its in many ways an impediment to free trade with countries outside the EU. This shouldn't be happening but it is. Due to its shortcoming in this area, there is a very clear agenda to strengthen the ""political union"" and this is absolutely unnecessary in my opinion, there is no reason whatsoever for any country in the EU to provide it with any more competences than they already have, absolutely no reason, but they disagree. Mr Juncker and people of his view want an EU Army to have a dick measuring contest with Russia and because he knows he's a fucking joke to Russia, to the U.S. and to any military power (and the UK is the biggest military power in the EU by many measures). Sorry but I don't want the European Union trying to play like its the United States and think its a superpower. It's just not. It was never given permission by Europeans to do so. I genuinely believe this is a pivotal moment and some of the EU's response to the Brexit vote has projected so much insecurity and weakness that I think a stiff breeze could now blow it over. A couple more states could be voting on membership very soon.. one could even be France... ",d4qzx98,d4qz6ne,4q3skk,0.999999931,0.999999862,Brexit,28-06-16
6281,2,Prituh,"The EU was never build to work together and prevent wars with outsiders. It was meant to do that with internal members and make a strong alliance to negotiate with outsiders. And that is what you have become now. Sad but true. Not saying it's correct but it is what it is and it's something that is known for a very long time.Member states won't be leaving until it's proven that leaving the EU will benefit them which is why they won't let you benefit. The only parties who are supporting good trade agreements and the ones that want to leave the EU as well without caring about the economic consequences. In other words, they would much rather have the country suffer to get more power back to their country (meaning themself). Which sounds nice if our leaders where less corrupt and power hungry. Which they aren't ofcourse. This has been proven without a doubt by the lies of the leave campaign.Let me clarify the problem between Flemish and Walloons as well.

Only less bad ones.Another point to consider is that from our point of view, it looks like the decision was mainly made because of immigration issues from which I conclude that the people of Britain made this decision out of self interest without trying to be social.

From what I got from the vote, is that the UK doesn't want the free movement in people into the UK so I imagine that this could be a breaking point in the negotiations. Is that fair to say? None of this had been done before. There is no precedent. There is so many unknowns.I know the EU isn't perfect but I believe the problems we are currently facing as a species are global problems. Problems such as Climate change, rising seawaters, Overpopulation, etc etc are global problems and need to be solved on a global scale. The EU isn't perfect but a union of nations like the EU is a good platform to enable tackling these problems. These problems can not and will not be solved by individual countries and may only be solved by countries working together.I guess if people really thought the EU was broken, why not try and fix and reform it from within the EU.

6329,2,IncognitoBadass,"Wow you actually responded to a lot more than my comment, but I'll try to answer as many points you make.Firstly, if your rebuttal of European Democracy is that too much responsibility is put on the shoulders of European commission then I'd have to disagree. You argue the EC is an executive branch of the EU, but then again the EU is mainly a regulatory government to begin with. I don't agree with your reasoning, I do agree that the EU isn't exactly a democratic body of government.When talking about the Greece crisis you do have to take into consideration that Greece initially joined the EU under false numbers. There's a good reason that we have these qualifications for joining, we can't include unstable economies in the EU, because if they collapse (which Greece did) then there's no way to devalue the currency, there's no way for the government to go bankrupt. That means there's no way out of the collapse. A valid point of criticism which was heard and milked out plenty was that EU officials did a poor job judging if Greece was ready for entry into the EU and you can be damn sure we learned from that mistake and we had the appetite to solve that problem (hence why Turkey won't be joining anytime soon). That being said I actually agree with how they handled it. With populists in Europe demanding all funding to Greece to be cut and Greek morons demanding no stricter tax laws the EU took the middle ground. Let me explain...One major cultural problem with the Greek population is [tax evasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion_and_corruption_in_Greece). So when the EU offered a bailout plan that for a large part consisted of fixing tax evasion it's no surprise that the Greek population revolted. When you're talking about a democratic deficit in light of what happened with Greece you fail to consider that the vote of the general public in Greece was in no way what's best for the country or Europe. In short: Greece voted for the EU to bail them out without any promise of Greece that they'd fix their economy. What would you have wanted the EU to do? Respect Greece's vote and bail Greece out unconditionally? Of course not! As far as I can remember every country in the EU had some sort of populist campaign to stop EU funding to Greece entirely. Criticizing the EU for basically vetoing the Greece vote rejecting our bailout plan is ludicrous, it's misguided and shortsighted. Either they'd have to leave the EU, devalue their currency and somehow climb out of the hole they dug themselves into or they'd have to adhere to EU standards and start taxing the population. As it turns out, EU standards for taxation proved quite beneficial to the economy.Secondly, the UK is politically widely viewed as the spoilt brat of  Europe. For as long as I can remember the UK has not made any significant contribution to politics in the EU, which I think is a real shame. Right now the EU is mostly led by France and Germany (it's even gotten to the point where Germany has to back down a bit because their population is scared of a repeat of history), they're the most powerful countries in the EU politically and economically and the UK has the potential to step in and help lead and reform the EU. But no, you chose to leave and however strong your country might be, uncertainty is a bitch as far as economics are concerned, as long as the UK doesn't make a firm decision no investor in their right mind would want to invest in the UK. If you expect your pound to recover you *NEED TO AT LEAST HAVE A PLAN* and so far no plan was made, in fact your prime-minister stepped down and it looks like the next in line is Blondie fucking Johnson.You want to be treated fairly because you've put money into the EU? Please, for fuck's sake, please! Plenty of countries in the EU put money in. For example the Dutch paid about 30% more taxes than in 2014 (chose 2014 for no particular reason) and about 2% NET of that is going to the EU, you're putting in less than half a percent NET. Yes, we put in more than you in total with 1/4th of your population. And you don't hear us complaining because we know what we're funding. The economy of Greece is recovering and Poland is growing fast. As a whole there is no stagnation, look at the average economic strength of Europe, we're growing. We're working towards a Europe that's economically strong in it's entirety, noone's left behind. Because we know that we can later reap the benefits of the seeds we sow. Not only that, we haven't had a war in Europe for over **70 fucking years** do you have any idea how thankful I am for that?! And you should be too! This whole brexit vote just reminds me of that annoying ex that always threatened to leave, but once you call the bluff and say ""fine, leave!"" it's nothing but backpedaling. As long as you don't push the button you're keeping the UK and the EU down with your economic uncertainty and being so hesitant and uncertain about art. 50 now that the votes are in doesn't exactly radiate confidence. Maybe that's because you aren't in fact confident you want to leave, your country has been torn apart and I've seen more bregrets than I can count. We are not trying to be some sort of superpower, we're trying to be a European **Union**.

6357,2,FarscapeSDC,"""Democracy is good... except when I don't get what I want, then it's bad.""Ultimately there are three forms of government you can have. Democracy, Oligarchy, and Autocracy.An Autocracy is a rule of one, where one person has near-ultimate power. If the person in charge is highly intelligent, benevolent, and wise, then such a system could be brilliant, but how do you determine such a leader? Do you go for a hereditary system, in which the leadership passes parent to child? Of course not, there's no guarantee that the child would be as kind and smart as the parent. What about an elective dictatorship, where the dictator is selected by public vote? Well, that's just demagoguery, where the most charismatic person is given total power for life. What about a technocratic system, where the most 'qualified' person is made dictator. But how do you define 'qualified'? Do you select the man with the highest IQ, or the woman with the most degrees, or the person with the longest career in poltics.... none of these adequately determine how a person will be as a leader.Autocracy is out then, so what about oligarchy, where a small group of individuals share total power. It's effectively democracy, but only the tiny group of leaders are allowed to vote, and they can only be removed from power by the other members of the oligarchy. Well, this has all the problems of the Autocracy, but it is slightly less drastic, because while each oligarch is a mini-dictator, they are kept in balance by the others. Unless, of course, the oligarchs are not all benevolent, intelligent, wise people who will use their powers responsibly, in which case you're back to the bad parts of dictatorship, except instead of one tyrant, you've got a group of them.So, what about democracy. Well, the average person is not a highly educated, wise, benevolent person who always acts altruistically. We know this. The average person votes in their own best interests. Why do you think so many 'remain' voters cited reasons like ""my job requires regular travel to Europe and having to show my passport at the borders would be inconvenient for me"", while leavers stated things like ""my business has been hurt by overly strict and pointless EU regulations""?But, at least with democracy, the people will get vaguely what they want. Instead of getting what a dictator wants, or what the oligarchy wants, you get what the majority of people wants. Surely that is a better system? A system where most people are made sort of happy, instead of one where some people are very happy and most are very unhappy.And, on top of that, a democracy allows you to vote out people you don't like. If the man you voted for doesn't represent your views, if he doesn't deliver the promises he made, you can vote for somebody else, meaning that the people you vote for have a vague notion that their power relies on your consent, and your consent will only be given if they do roughly what you want (or can convince you that their way is better).  This is opposed to Dictatorship or Oligarchy where, if you don't like the leaders, your only options are open revolt or to shut up and take it.",d4r3tsk,4q7aym,4q7aym,1,1,Brexit,28-06-16

6448,2,cluo40,"I'll try to provide you with a few facts then from a US bank's perspectiveFrom your FTSE rally argument, one day is also hardly a good indication of how the market is doing. It's pretty natural after two days of huge losses that there are buy opportunities for stocks that overshot. I know a lot of hedge funds are looking for opportunities in financials/insurance sector that dropped heavily in the last few days. As for a macro outlook, there's a lot going against the UK. - Loss of confidence will cause local investment and FDI to decrease in the short term. - Because of this economic slowdown, the Bank of England is expected to need to inject â‚¬250bn of stimulus but a lot of analysts are still predicting a recession- Inflation is on the rise due to pressures from both the deflating pound and the (expected) interest rate cut from 0.5% --- Altough exports do benefit from a falling pound, the combination of (short~medium term depending on negotations) loss of supply chain plus drop in domestic spending comes nowhere close to outweighing benefits - Growth projections revised down 1.5~3% (depending on which bank you look at) through 2017 for the UK, causing a 0.2% GDP drop for UK and 0.1% GDP drop worldwide. This also leads back to the possible recession. - An increasing public deficit and current account balance (see twin deficit) - In the long run, the big problem is just being able to reintegrate with the global economy. I have no doubt that it can be done but the expected time frame for renegotiating every trade agreement is upwards of 15 years currently. Additionally, the EU will be ruthless in its negotiation as they have every incentive to make an example out of the UK to serve as a disincentive for other countries to leave. edit: Also the parity news is admittedly a bit extreme. I just took a look at our projections and it looks like the target for the GBPUSD is 1.35 temporarily and 1.25 for year end.

The last episode of this kind of ""bargaining"" is the special deal between Cameron and the Commission, back in February. If the UK had voted to stay in the EU, it would have had all of what was promised by the Leave campaigners and more. That's the paradox, that's the reason why the entire world, in its disbelief, is mocking the UK. You had a strong voice in the EU Parliament, you had a special status (you already had more privileges and fewer obligations than EEA countries even before the Deal of Febrary, FFS), you even had a way to (temporarily and under certain circumstances, yes, but still more than what could be said about ANY OTHER country in the Union) control immigration, you had rebates, and I could go on and on and on.

Lastly, regarding the discussions undergoing about the future of UK in the EU market, if they were to sign a EEA deal (and at this point I'm not even sure this would be on the table, but let's assume for argument's sake) they'd still have to adhere to EU legal acts (the aforementioned regulations, directives and so forth) and allow free circulation of people, goods and services. Free circulation of people, as in ""still not having any kind of control on immigration"". And, vae victis, they'd have absolutely NO SAY in the EU politics.

6497,2,Actualprey,Not that history is a good indicator of how the future will pan out but in Scotland's case they need to remember what happened with the Darien Company.  The Scots essentially wanted the English government to go to war against the Portuguese in the Panama region where they had a colony.The English declined and the colony failed.  The Scots hung three innocent English sailors due to public anger and then went cap in hand to the English government who offered to cover the losses in the failed bid in exchange for union (about Â£81million in today's money).So whilst I am completely for the right to self determination if you decide to self-determine you have to accept the responsibility for any losses or detrimental effects that this may bring.  My view is that the Scottish people have a weird hatred for English politicians which may stretch back to the Darien Company era.

There's so much more to a person and their opinions than side A and side B. The only way to get to those opinions is to listen to the person you are actually talking to. NOT the person you've labeled them as based on this general perception. Once you've labeled them ""left"" or ""right"", you've thrown all individuality and individual reason out the window. You've applied your own reasons why they didn't vote ""leave"" or ""stay"", and that allows you to keep your humility tucked away in some tiny crack of your brain.Which is why we get the graphs that show how stupid the majority of leave voters are. I mean, yeah, that's not the kindling for prejudice at fucking all....This coming from people who are pro immigration, and feel people shouldn't be generalized.All of this attitude, all of it, is why everyone on every fucking side is ""evil"" and *wants* to destroy the world.

Tariff barriers are unlikely, but as with all FTAs the UK will need to trade off depth â€“ which means agreeing common standards and regulation â€“ with independence.Swiss-style bilateral accordsThe UK and the EU agree a set of bilateral accords which govern UK access to the single market in specific sectors.

6658,2,Trimalchio8,"The Reasonable Argument(s) for Brexit I have created this text as a response to another Reddit user who suggested that there is nobody on Reddit (in their right mind) who voted Leave in the recent EU Referendum in Britain.I myself voted to Remain, but I wanted to play Devil's Advocate (and not Troll) to see if I could outline the reasonable argument or arguments for Brexit that isn't based on lies about EU membership costs or fears of mass immigration; in order to help Reddit users, inside and outside of the UK, understand the reasons for why this has happened. Or, failing that, at least show some of the factors that may have led otherwise perfectly reasonable people to have voted for Brexit.In this text, I am not going to talk about two of the Leave campaigns key claims: 1) that the UK sends Â£350 million pounds a week to the EU; 2) there is, and will be more, mass immigration from Turkey after it joins as well as from ex-soviet and eastern european countries. These claims, in my view and in the view of many others (for instance, see the BBC's EU Referendum reality check) are highly misleading. I am also not going to mention nostalgia, patriotism or nationalism - due to the fact they are woolly concepts and may or may not have played a part on both sides. I am however going to talk about the following: Austerity; Ignorance and/or Apathy; A Lack of a Positive Case for Europe; and Democracy/Sovereignty. So strap in!**Austerity**For those who don't already know, austerity is where a government deliberately reduces public spending. This can be due to economic hardship, or just for political reasons. In 2010, the UK elected a coalition government of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. Due to the 2008 financial crash, the Conservatives (who are our business friendly party) wanted to impose austerity on the country, and the Liberal Democrats went along with it. Now, public services comprise of a variety of different things such as education, health service, as well as the welfare system, or benefits for people who are unable to work. Is it more complicated than this? I guess so, but I don't think it is much more complicated; only that there are public services and different aspects of austerity I am unable to cover without boring you senseless. These are, I hope, the broad brush-strokes of our political/social landscape before the EU referendum: austerity measures meaning cuts to public services.So what has this got to do with Brexit or voting leave? Well, due to the cuts to the public services (as well as, in the NHS's case, election pledges of funding that were misleading) many reasonable people began to seek an explanation for the following: why they are waiting excessive periods for treatment in Hospitals; why their children are unable to get into local schools or 'good' schools; why there is a lack of social housing; and so on. One explanation is of course austerity. Reduced funding means fewer hospital beds, fewer school places and fewer homes. However, another explanation is that of increased pressure on the public services. Which can either be by more people coming to live in a country (immigration) or by those public services becoming naturally overstretched - and by this I mean, for instance, a rise in obesity leading to an increased strain on hospitals; or more children being born leading to fewer school places. Of course, funding these services or reducing austerity would solve these problems, but whether that is really feasible depends on your political viewpoint.However, and whether this is right or wrong, the Leave campaign and Leave voters decided that reducing immigration is the best solution - and not austerity. In my view, this can be a reasonable view if you consider that this view was not based solely on fear, and that the anti-austerity argument was not made during campaigning. Let me explain - I am not justifying any scaremongering on the grounds of immigration, I am merely explaining how reaching this conclusion is logical, and so reasonable. So why was the anti-austerity argument not made? Well, the first reason is that the Conservative party is our current government, and our government sided with remain; and so for it to tell people that austerity is the problem and not EU migration, and so therefore you should vote remain, was just not feasible - as it was responsible for imposing austerity. The second reason, potentially, is that all the opposition to the Conservative party (not just Labour) was just not vocal enough on this matter - due to euroscepticism within the other parties and usual party politics; there may also have been a media bias determined to freeze out the views of the other parties, but that is speculation.Had the anti-austerity argument been made and shouted from the roof-tops would it have changed the way the country voted? Possibly, but who am I to say? Without it being made, it is perfectly understandable that people who are fed up of the current situation vis-a-vis lack of school places and hospital beds chose to vote for Brexit in order to control immigration. Whether that is right or wrong is not for me to say.**Ignorance and/or Apathy**It is a trite argument to suggest that a majority of people (unfortunately, although I have to use the word 'working-class' to qualify this statement, I simply mean the average person who works for a living) do not care about politics - but it is rather a circular argument. So instead of examining this view, I think it would be better to explore the view that people are disillusioned or unable to care - and that this referendum was hijacked by anti-establishment sentiment and general apathy.For this argument, I would like to point out that it is difficult to find time in a working day to read every single political development, particularly if you have to care for others or have other jobs or tasks or even hobbies to do. And from this point of view, it is difficult for anybody to stay constantly informed about politics - and more so where cumbersome EU institutions are involved. To say that somebody is ignorant or doesn't care about politics is therefore condescending and patronising as, for one, it suggests that politics is the preserve of somebody who studies it or follows it extensively. Politics is unfortunately for all of us and we should all have a say in it. This point links into democracy and I'll come back to it shortly. I apologise if you (like me) are not convinced by this argument - that is, in reality political engagement is difficult when people are more concerned about putting food on the table, for instance, and naturally feel removed from the political world. Again, I don't believe this in itself leads to ignorance; but I guess it can lead to apathy. There is certainly a separate argument for anti-establishment feeling also, particularly as it became clear that David Cameron (our Prime Minister) would have to step down following a Leave vote. For some people, particularly on the left, this was motivation enough.**A Lack of a Positive Case for Europe**If you were to sell EU membership to me today, how would you do it? Certainly this is a much more difficult argument to make than the one that suggests we should remain in Europe because that's the way it's been for a long time. But it is not an impossible argument to make, and it could have been made if the benefits of single market access had been sold, as well as with greater political influence and the benefits of human rights and other such protections and regulations. There are still issues with the EU, and nobody should pretend to deny that; but then again, there are issues with all institutions and systems.Notwithstanding, because this positive-EU argument was not made, and a more negative campaign on the consequences of leaving was adopted, many people saw Leave as the more positive and perhaps sensible option. As well as the fact immigration concerns weren't addressed by an anti-austerity message above. Why would you vote to remain in something if you weren't fully aware of, or convinced by, its benefits? So far then, the reasonable arguments for choosing Brexit are: immigration as an explanation for recent problems post 2008 (to be distinguished from a general fear of immigration); potential disaffection due to the fact many people live busy lives and/or are overworked and so find it difficult to engage with politics, as well as the fact Brexit could lead to David Cameron's resignation; and, finally, a lack of positive arguments for remaining or for remaining to reform the EU. This just leaves the argument of democracy/sovereignty.**Democracy/Sovereignty**The final argument for voting Leave goes something like this: we, as a country, are unable to make our own laws as Parliament is not sovereign and is subject to the laws and decisions of the European Union's various bodies. Moreover, EU officials are often seen as unaccountable and unelected.This argument, however, depends upon your own views of what constitutes democracy and sovereignty. There are arguments against viewing the EU as undemocratic, and one of them is the idea of a 'double election'. That is, whoever we elect in our country then chooses who represents us in the EU, for instance in the European Commission and the Council of Europe. Moreover, we do also directly elect Ministers for European Parliament (MEPs). However, unfortunately some MEPs are from the UK Independence Party and have a long track record of not turning up to vote in the European Parliament - fulfilling the prophecy that we have no say over Europe or little influence.But the argument remains, if I didn't like an EU official (who has a say over me and my life) could I get rid of them? Well, that would depend on why you would want to get rid of them; but you can't directly vote them out, if that's what you're getting at. So therefore, the EU is anti-democratic. Although this view, and this conclusion, is dismissed as too simplistic, it is a concern for some people. And during campaigning it was not directly addressed - and thus is a loosely reasonable argument for Brexit.Sovereignty, by contrast, is more difficult. EU Law is supreme and a variety of EU legislation - Treaty articles, regulations and directives - is used in every member state. This has led to many jokes (mostly false) about the length and amount of these regulations - particularly those relating to fruit and vegetables. Domestic Parliament and its citizens must abide by these rules, or face the consequences. However, whether this is really a problem again depends on your point of view. Is it a real issue, or an imagined one? Certainly EU Law being supreme, and laws being made overseas, can be worrying; but it is difficult to think of any major incidents recently where the UK's hands were tied over a serious or controversial issue. But maybe the potential for abuse by the EU is enough.**Conclusion**So after all of this - immigration as an explanation, unavoidable apathy, lack of a positive EU view, arguably (and I stress the word arguably) anti-democratic and anti-sovereign institutions - why did I vote to remain?Well, I voted remain because I wanted economic and political stability, and because it seems to me that immigration is unavoidable - and only because single market access to the EU, as I understand it, requires free movement of people. That's not to say that nothing should be done which caused instability, or that I'm unaware of the effects of long-term immigration in certain areas. If anything, I was disappointed with the conduct of both sides in this referendum, and I feel that choosing remain was the best of a bad situation. Personally, I'm not sure I'd want to be in the EU as it is at the moment, all things considered - reform is clearly needed. But then again, maybe it is better than being on the outside. I guess we shall we see now that 'we've decided'.",NA,NA,4q6bza,2.79E-25,-1,Against,28-06-16

We noted in our Brexit study that if the UK were to â€˜become like Norwayâ€™ by joining EEA, 93 out of the 100 costliest EU-derived regulations would remain in place at a cost of Â£31.4bn per year (94.3% of the total cost). This is because many EU policy areas would continue to apply to the UK including financial services, social and employments laws, energy and climate change policies, and this is where the bulk of the regulatory cost stems from.While the EEA Agreement includes provisions for the non-EU members to be consulted on new legislation, the EEA states have:â€¢No veto in the European Councilâ€¢No votes in the Council of Ministers â€“ where national governments vote on EU legislationâ€¢No MEPs or votes in the European Parliamentâ€¢No European Commissioner and no European Commission staffâ€¢No judges or staff at the European Court of Justice (ECJ)Despite lacking voting rights and full participation in the EU institutions, Norway must still make a sizeable contribution to the EU budget. Looking at its recent contributions, Norway pays â‚¬656m to the EU but gets back around â‚¬100m in science and research grants, which makes a per capita net contribution of â‚¬107.4. In contrast, Britainâ€™s net contribution of around â‚¬9bn works out as â‚¬139 per capita.As a member of the EEA, Norway must apply the same free movement rules as EU member states, but has no vote on the rules. In Norwayâ€™s experience this actually results in far higher inward EU migration than the UK, when measured as a percentage of the countriesâ€™ total populations.",NA,NA,4q6ehm,0.000120281,-0.999759437,Against,28-06-16

The incredibly important decision to leave or remain in the EU ends up in 51% leave 48% remain, which is practically 50/50, and one of the two stances wins? Not discussing which decision is better just the fact that something like this ends up decided by a coin toss. In democracy, normally is the 70% of the people who screw over the remaining 30% NOT one half of the country screwing over the other HALF?!I'm not British, I don't mind the result, I'm just very surprised by this. I see a lot of people saying that the remain voters should shut up and accept the result which I would find a reasonable demand if the results weren't that close! I would have imagined that something like this would require a supermajority to go forward not a simple majority. Something like this is very problematic. If there is some type of crisis (I'm not saying that there is going to be one) having 1 half of the country opposed to the other half can rise a lot of tension. Also, as far as I know, Scotland did have an abundant majority in favour of remaining, which means that they can feel left out and ignored.

6713,2,nydinger,"Could the referendum be reversed? What would be worse, a minimum five year term of your political opponents leading the country, or the forseeable future as a non EU member country?Here's a theory of how the outcome of the referendum could be reversed? It's not easy, but it is more than possible considering the state of mind people of the UK are in. As a hypothetical, what do you think, would this be possible?Letâ€™s start by a few facts:â€¢	The referendum was advisory, it was not binding. The parliament could choose to ignore the result.â€¢	A fairly large quantity of â€œLeaveâ€-voters already regrets their choice and would change their vote today.â€¢	General elections will be held at the latest in 2020, but considering the leadership crisis in both main parties, probably long before that. â€¢	The minimum term of office for a government is 5 years, which is not long compared to the number of years it would take to get back into the EU, once left. â€¢	A later reentry into the EU would result in a much worse deal for the UK.â€¢	Remember - almost any decision can be reversed.In this situation the deep feelings of sorrow and almost despair amongst the nationâ€™s youth is a growing foundation for political action. But the action must be clear and â€“ this is the most important part â€“ it must be non-divisive amongst the remain-voters. Itâ€™s important that the issue at hand is whether to remain in the EU or to leave the EU, nothing else.So what is the suggested solution? Be open minded and keep reading even after the first and second bullet points, even though they might seem far fetched.â€¢	Register a political party around the one and only issue â€“ keeping the UK a part of EU.â€¢	Get a political leadership team for this party that preferably comes from both the political right and the left, people that can put most other issues aside to work together on this one issue for a couple of years. Yes, years.  â€¢	State that this political party has only one mission, and that is to stop UK from leaving the EU (nothing else â€“ remember, it has to be non-divisive amongst the remain-voters).â€¢	Commit to that this political party will support a government of any of the three political parties (Labour, Tories or LibDems) that will work to keep UK in EU.â€¢	This party will commit to supporting Tories, Labour or LibDems regardless of their other political agendas as long as they work to stay in the union. (UKIP is not really an option, since the whole reason for their existence is that they want to leave the EU).â€¢	The party's potential MPs will commit to not vote on any other issues and thus leave all other decisions to the ordinary parliamentary system - thus making it as democratic and still as non divisive as possible.â€¢	Spread the knowledge about this â€œsingle-issue partyâ€ firstly amongst the young population of UK. They are easier to reach through social media and are also the ones most affected by the â€œleaveâ€-result.â€¢	Start crowd funding to finance the party (only available from the UK, since I guess UK political parties mustn't be financed from other countries).â€¢	Convince as many people as possible that even 5-8 years with the opposition in power is better than the foreseeable future outside of the EU.As long as this new â€œRemain In the EUâ€ party, stays on track, and do not delve into other political discussions, I believe there are a lot of people that would happily support this party, even though it might lead to their usual political opponents claiming the power during the next five year period. Bear in mind that even if your usual political opponents might get an extra term of office, the havoc they may cause will probably be a lot less than all the ramifications a Brexit will cause, and the government can be switched 5 years later, a Brexit cannot.Well isnâ€™t this just a pipe dream? Would this actually be possible?At the moment there are a lot of people looking for a way to change the outcome of the referendum. People are truly devastated and grasping for all options. The political leadership of both the Tories and the Labour party are breaking apart. Scotland has put the option of leaving the UK back on the table. There is talk about Northern Ireland seceding from the UK. Gibraltar voted over 90% ""Remain"". If there is anytime this might work, I'd say it is now. To find political opponents that would unify around this one issue would show a strong leadership that would inspire a lot of young (and possibly older) people to join the movement.Unless the party starts having opinions on other issues, they would likely be able to find supporters from the other parties (with the exception of UKIP). Best part of it all, no one can claim this disregards democracy (at least no one with a basic understanding of the meaning of the word).So, would this work?

6775,2,JamieD86,"There's a lot to respond to there, I'll do my best with the time I have.(I can only talk about the Commission and Greece here before I am too busy tonight, I can come back and talk about the EU and war etc. later on, maybe tomorrow.)First I'd like to start with the European Commission. It IS the Executive Body of the European Union, this is not a description I ""choose"" to give it, that's what it is. It is not a mere regulator appointed by a government, it is EU body responsible for proposing legislation. The President of the European Commission is the most powerful position in the European Union. The President has the responsibility to dictate tasks to commissioners which he can choose to change at any time, and even has the power to force a Commissioner to resign. Effectively no legislation can be proposed without his approval. This is not a mere regulatory body over a markerplace, it more akin to a 28-strong governmental cabinet of a political union. The European Union is not just a markerplace and the commission are not just regulators. Their powers and competences absolutely should require a popular mandate of some sort, but they don't have it.Now as for Greece, firstly Greece was doing fine as a member of the European Union since it joined the European Communities in 1981. It only became a problem when it joined the Eurozone in 2001. I'd just like to remind you that Greece hadn't long been away from essentially a militarized dictatorship and had only years before admission to the EU solidified its new direction with democracy when it endorsed a new constitution. That's relevant when you consider what has happened to its ability to make sovereign decisions in its own parliament since ~2009.Yes, the Greek government hid debts from the European Union (with help!) but when it hit its crisis it effectively had several choices. One choice was to exit the Euro and take the route of currency devaluation to regain competitiveness as it had done before. Risky? ABSOLUTELY, but it wouldn't be the first time. The truth is the Eurozone leaders had no appetite to lose an economy less than a decade after the Euro went into wide circulation and made pledges and promises to Greece in the early days. Those pledges and promises became DEMANDS later on.Don't try to sell the EU's intervention in Greece as some kind of humanitarian cause saving Greece from itself. The fact is the key reason for avoiding a Greek default and exit was contagion. Remember, at the time Spain, Portugal and Italy were also in serious trouble, are also members of the Eurozone. There was also contagion risks to the financial systems of other countries. Avoiding a default and Eurozone exit was LESS about saving Greece and more about protecting the Eurozone from a problem it had been warned about before the launch of the currency itself (that a currency union could work in the North, but not in the South). For the average Greek that had next to nothing to do with the crisis, the response from the Eurozone was cold and indifferent to human suffering. Yes, you are right, populists and EU nationalists called for expelling Greece and/or painful punitive measures, which only goes to further the point that the EU is a very cold hearted place at times. Olli Rehn is the man I find the most repulsive in all of this, in how he intervened in elections and parliamentary debates by effectively threatening Greece with bankruptcy if it didn't do exactly as it was told by the European Commission. I remember one older Greek describing the national feeling that in the space of a generation, the Greek people had dumped one dictatorship for another and there was a lot of truth to that.During this crisis, Greeks witnessed the rise of the hardened far left and far right. A rise in lawlessness and crime hit the country, leading to an increase in homicides and suicides. In the rural parts of the country, barter systems were observed. Vital public services were hit, with hospitals not even able to buy supplies or drugs and were forced into cutbacks, which has been correlated with a rise in disease and health problems in the country. Thousands of Greek women turned to illegal street prostitution to support themselves and their families. The EU/Eurozone moved to protect itself and was completely indifferent to the suffering that resulted, turning large parts of Greece effectively into a thid world country.And for what? The fact is Greece will HAVE to default or have some kind of debt relief sooner or later. All the pathways to sustainability rely on unrealistic growth that goes on for YEARS, and that's not going to happen, and this issue is going to come to the forefront again very soon and you know, as well as I do, that the can will once again be kicked down the road. Debt to GDP at over 175%, the highest youth unemployment in Europe not far off 50%, and it's not even alone in this. Italy hit 40% youth unemployment last year, debt to GDP ratio of over 130%. Recent poll showed that if the Italians were offered the same referendum the Brits had, 48% would DEFINITELY vote to leave as things are right now, and that does NOT imply 52% would stay at all. 48% disapproval before the debate even begins is extremely high.Spain has less debt on paper as a measure of GDP (90% of GDP IIRC, of external debt) but also has youth unemployment up to 45% and major questions now being asked about the feasibility of its post-recession plans. Portugal has less youth unemployment, around 30% IIRC, but debt to GDP in the region of 130%. Whatever way you look at it, the Eurozone was warned about Southern Europe failing in a currency union and that has come to pass, and the Eurozone is only papering over the cracks and lying to itself. These young folk are the first generation of the Eurozone kids and it has UTTERLY failed them.See, there is always more than one side to things this complicated, but the EU and the Euronationalists who adore it can only ever see responsibility for failure elsewhere. The Eurozone is failing, the ECB is keeping it afloat, and of course the solutions put forward to fix the problem is consolidation of powers and competences to Brussels. Eurocrats are thoroughly incapable of seeing their projects as part of any problem.. and that's a major problem for us all.(Will continue at some point later, too busy!)",d4rup9c,d4r1wpf,4q3skk,0.999998657,0.999997313,Brexit,29-06-16

6815,2,JamieD86,"SECOND RESPONSE...Ok, I've been able to find a few minutes to respond to more of the message. I'd like to start by informing you that I'M NOT BRITISH, so your insults toward the UK mean nothing much to me at all and will provoke no response.You are Dutch? Well that's good, and I'm eagerly awaiting what will happen after your elections in the Spring next year.Now, I alluded in my first reply that things are not cosy in the European Union, particularly in the South. The Southern countries that are tied to the montary union, specifically Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece are not doing well, they have amassed enormous debt and are setting records for youth unemployment. They all have considerable problems to face just down the road, so don't pretend like things are all rosy, they aren't. And as for economic uncertainly, Europe has had little certainly for the better part of a decade, and a LOT of stagnation. Even EU leaders admit that stagnation is a major problem now.I addressed those countries and the EU / Eurozone's complete indifference to suffering and damage its own policies caused to Greece in particular in my other reply so I won't go on about it now.I will however respond to comments about war and peace. Let's start with post-WW1. Germans turned to the National Socialists because their hands were tied behind their backs by the victors of WWI. The Treaty of Versailles was crippling in its punitive nature and they turned to a party that openly rejected it. Germans were also treated terribly by their neighbors. Look up footage of French people who would jeer and routinely assault German people. Essentially, the aftermath of World War 1 is the cause of World War 2, and that's roundly accepted.However, yes, I agree, trade between Germany and France after the second world war was the beginning of the process of thawing relations between the countries. I have no qualms with crediting the coal and steel alliance and some European integration later with avoiding the two of them going go blows again, and also for a long time limiting German power and influence.But there is OTHER factors that prevented major war. WW2 was far more horrific than WW1 for many reasons, not least of which include the mass bombing of civilian populations, the holocaust too, etc. WW2 also ended with the Soviet Union in occupation of much of Eastern Europe and Germany... and one of the most influential developments in the history of human conflict... WW2 concluded with the development of the atomic bomb.The potential cost of going to war in a post-nuke world is far higher than in a pre-nuke world, and Soviet Union became a common enemy of the West in a Cold War that went on for decades and could have become an apocalyptic hot war if not for mutually assured destruction and a lack of will between East and West to find out what happens in an open nuclear conflict.So... did European integration help to stop a major war? Probably yes, but does the European Union as it is now take credit for this? No, not exactly. As said, there was plenty of other factors outlined above, and the fact is the coal and steel alliance and early trading in Europe is not the same thing as the huge bureaucracy that now oversees the POLITICAL union known as the EU. Also, when did the conflict in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo slip out of people's memories? Notice the language people use to sidestep this grim conflict in Europe, they say ""Oh we haven't had a MAJOR war"" in 70 years, which is rather underestimating that conflict and what it could have become without the intervention of NATO, for all its flaws it could have been much worse. The European Union can't claim credit now for the fragile resolution to that conflict.Now, why do I say the EU may be dangerous? Ukraine! The regime of Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and has been meddling in Eastern Ukraine for a couple of years. The EU shares blame in the lead up to this conflict because it courted a country with LARGE divisions. Most people of Crimea speak Russian and identify as Russian, as Crimea was part of Russia. In Eastern Ukraine there are also a large number of people who identify as Russian.The EU through the association agreement was opening the door for Ukraine, including Crimea, to join the EU. The EU should have been more careful given that it was inevitably going to cause protest in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine, but they pushed ahead anyway and urged Ukraine to move away from Russia to Europe. We all know what happened next, Russia intervened militarily and the EU ran away with its tail between its legs. Now in that aftermath, Mr Juncker wants an army to deter Russia. That's what i mean by dangerous! This hope to turn the European Union into the frontline of the new Cold War and to make the internal affairs of Ukraine and other former soviet satellites the MILITARY responsibility of EU states.

Did you swallow everything he told you wholesale? If not, why do you think the other side did?I'm a huge fan of the EEC; I support free trade, free movement of people, and free exchange of ideas for scientific and developmental growth for mutual benefit.I'M NOT a fan of political union between 28 member states that tries to fit the entire political spectrum into a one-size-fits-all model, especially when neither I nor 497million other EU citizens were given a voice on the matter. Only Ireland was, and when they voted against it they were told to vote again until they got the right answer.I'm old enough to remember life before the EU's current incarnation. I remember the Maastricht protests, and how people howled about not having a say then. I remember the Euro launch party in Brussels, where the 500-Euro note was a sign of Europe's mighty economy. And I moved to Poland in 2004, in time to see it join the club, all starry-eyed with wonder at the vast riches it would receive.12 years later, Poland and every other country east of Berlin are still poor, thanks to being forced to live on farming handouts rather than any real economic development initiative. Spain's youth employment lies in smoking ruins. Not just a generation but the entire Greek populace have been forced into penury, and for what? So that Junker and Merkel can unite us all in a common dream, a common goal that the UK has voted against time and time again, with nothing to show for.Staying in the EU means being dragged down a path whether you want to go that way or not. That path is littered with broken democracy, failed economies, backstabbing and selfserving policies that keep Germany and France rich at the expense of the other 26 states, who are told to be happy on the bones they're thrown. Britain has been powerless to stop it, and purely thanks to immense trade and position of 2nd largest economy in Europe (and 5th globally), managed to secure a few opt-outs to protect your British interests. As cameron showed in his pre-Brexit negotiations, that position is no longer tenable, and the EU will no longer offer the UK any special treatment; it's Junker's way or the highway. I'm proud of the Brits who chose to reject that totalitarianism.So before you smear half your countrymen as xenophobic racists, Sun readers or illiterate simpletons, have a good think and consider why the people who voted to Remain in the EEC 41 years ago now decided so strongly to reject the EU.

What matters though, is what the EU does the moment Britain triggers Article 50, and/or what happens the moment Cameron steps down.

Brussels and Berlin have already made it very clear that there will definitely not be automatic access to the single market, and that's a reassuring first step - but that's hardly enough. Tariffs for British exports, visa requirement for British travelers, even the removal of the pound from IMF's SDR basket. Let me be clear: this is ***not*** about petty vendetta. Britain have to be made an example for many reasons. First, countries like France and Germany are grappling with a far right insurgence the past years, and this will be a good way to show them just how bad an idea an exit from the EU is. *Far more importantly*, the EU needs to re-establish that they are a serious, stable, and united trading, economic, and political bloc. They need to reassure the international community that they can be depended to do the right thing, that they can be trusted on issues like global trade, currency reliability, Russia, Middle East, refugees management. The EU is responsible for the welfare for the rest of its member states, and the last thing they should do is to be held captive by what Britain did. *They must not jeopardize the Union and it's people in order to placate the British people*, and by not punishing Britain in the harshest legal way possible, they will let down the citizens of the other member states, and worse, the rest of the world.

Many of the â€˜expertsâ€™ people are referring to are MEPâ€™s, big businesses, Banks and economists. And yes, there track record is to say the least doubtful.MEPâ€™s are in a majority pro EU as the MEPâ€™s are payed by the EU, did usually go to the EU because of their love for the EU. For the same reason, a MEP that has a critical voice is much more valuable. So that is where those â€˜expertsâ€™, NOT scientist!! Sort of fall of the list of list of reliable experts.Big business have a similar relationship with the EU. Lobby is a huge part of the EU, and so the EU gives those businesses a lot of power. It is then to be expected that they are pro-EU.Then the banks.. Well their policies and the things they where is favor of (Euro) resulted in the first big crisis the EU has to handle, and is still not recovered from, the Euro crisis. So they have an extremely bad track record. Also donâ€™t forget that many of these â€˜expertsâ€™ also had very negative scenarioâ€™s about the UK voting against joining the Euro. Now looking back, pretty much everybody agrees that it was a very good decisions to NOT join the Euro.Many of these so called experts are people working in or directly with Brussels, and you also now see something very interesting happening there. They is talk about â€˜punishingâ€™ the UK by not giving them a good deal (what also shows that they donâ€™t care for good trade and friendship in Europe, or even economics (as a bad deal id not only bad for the UK but also for the EU), they are just power hungry people.). But more important is that is shows that these â€˜expertsâ€™ clearly are not so sure of their own predictions about how bad it would be for the UK.If leaving the EU is really so bad there is no reason punish them with a bad deal. The EU could make a good deal with them (good for our good friends the UK and good for us) and the UK would have punished themselves as them leaving the UK would be bad for them.But no, they need to be punished. That is strange. Well not really, I even see many people who were against the Brexit explaining it as.. Making a good deal with the UK would be suicide for the EU as the UK would start doing better resulting in more countries wanting to leave the EU.What proof that these so called experts are not so much experts, our their â€˜adviceâ€™ is not based on their expertise, but they have a politic agenda that they try to carry out.That are the so called experts you are referring to, and are so mad at me for not paying too much attention to. They are no they experts and they fore sure are no true scientist. Politics and economics are not a true scientific field. I am all for science and scientist. But some parts of live simply donâ€™t fit that category.Now I did not yet address one group of the people I mention before, and that are the economists. That is in fact the group where you see the most dividing between people saying it is good and those saying it is bad. The media tents to show mainly those that said it would be bad, but as an example, the research company Capital Economics did calculate the expected results of The Netherlands leaving the EU. You canâ€™t find their research here: http://www.pvv.nl/images/Rapport_NExit_full_ENG.pdf The outcome was that (as you can read) that at first it would result in a hit on the Dutch economy (just as we now see in the UK) but would at the long run result in economic growth and safe the Netherlands Billions of money.Critics btw say that we should not look at the report because this (commercially and independent) research company would be anti EU. What I find funny as they are at least not in any way related to the EU. But I am supposed to listen to the very politic pro EU driven expers?Come on man, itâ€™s not about me being a self-proclaimed expert.

6989,2,IncognitoBadass,"Yes, let's talk about Greece.Firstly, the Eurozone leaders have absolutely no way to stop Greece from defaulting if they so desire. I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make here, because just 2 paragraphs later you argue that the EU commission threatened Greece with bankruptcy. Do you know what a **default** means? It means **bankruptcy**. So this default, the very thing the Eurozone leaders are trying so hard to avoid because of their so called indifference... is what they're threatening them with? Honestly what are you on about? I honestly don't know what side you're taking here.I'm not trying to sell EU bailouts in Greece as some sort of humanitarian intervention, they are at their core economic interventions with economic motives. Greece was at the brink of bankruptcy and a default would be bad news for not only Greece, but for the entire continent. But what is your ideal outcome if I may ask. Really, the only thing you're consistent about is that the EU is evil and the commission has wicked motives. I've seen no evidence of the motives you're describing, in every EU parliamentary debate I've seen I see the members speaking with passion and with a dream, even more so in the past few weeks in light of the UK referendum. I believe in the European goal and I think the EU project is (if not perfect) the best platform we have to reach it. I'm willing to concede that the EU has on certain areas handled situations incompetently, but not maliciously and the best way to deal with incompetence and to improve on the EU is not to leave it.Every country in the world has debts. [The US of A](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-debt-to-gdp) have a debt of 105% of their GDP. Also you should really be saying [Spain has a youth unemployment **down to 45%**](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/spain/youth-unemployment-rate) and the same goes for [Italy](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/italy/youth-unemployment-rate), they're both recovering. Yes it went up during/after the recession but everyone suffered at that time and unemployment/decrease in GDP/increase in national debt is expected when facing a massive recession. The fact of the matter is [the EU hasn't stagnated, it's growing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union) and you're worse off out, economically and politically.Economically the EU is doing well, it's doing what it was supposed to do. The Euro was supposed to slow inflation and it did. Really, the only outlier here is... Greece, and as far as I can see that's not due how the EU handled (or rather, is still handling) the situation, but due to major human error, not malicious intent, in letting them join the Eurozone.Now onto your second reply.Yes WWII was the deadliest war in human history and the EU (or actually the EEC) wasn't responsible for improving relationships between major European countries, but the result of it. Yes, there were also other factors preventing another major war. But I don't think a lot of good came from mutual assured destruction between the Soviet Union and the USA and I don't even think that's remotely relevant when talking about internal conflicts in Europe. MAD led to the cold war and a lot of very close calls that could have easily led to a Fallout-like scenario. The main difference you can see between increased costs of going to war and improved relationships between countries to prevent going to war is easily visible when you consider there has been ZERO military tension internally between EU countries and tension between the USA and the SU reached record levels. Also, just to put it out there, not only was the Croat-Bosniak war before the EEC turned into the EU, it was also an external conflict. The EU also doesn't really have any way to enforce their wills so it really makes sense that the EU can't resolve a conflict very well. You annexed Crimea? Stop this nonsense now or we'll... we'll use sanctions... I guess. Germany and France want an EU army so that they can enforce foreign policies and stand up against Putin, but I think that all that will do is cue an arms race and a standoff between Europe and Russia. Besides, we already have NATO what could an EU army possibly accomplish? Good thing we have the [UK to stand up to France and Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/08/jean-claude-juncker-calls-for-eu-army-european-commission-miltary) and keep the prospect of an EU army at bay... oh wait.",d4sda97,d4rup9c,4q3skk,0.999970543,0.999941086,Brexit,29-06-16

There is Lisboa treaty stripping countries of a huge share of sovereignity, limits for growing crops(in my country a lot of sugar factories went out of business not because of market competition, but because there were limits for my country how much sugar we can produce), subsidies for everything ruining the market, incentive to split Germany-caused immigration problem across the countries, ... I could name dozen of things why I think EU is really annoying. 13 years ago I've voted for my country to join EU. But this is not what I've signed up for. Really it's not about light bulbs. There used to be jokes about silly regulations EU is trying to enforce, but these days you can't be sure what is a joke and what is the fact. Try to guess yourself: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/11248616/Quiz-crazy-EU-law-or-made-up-law.htmlBecause those numbers are for the whole lifetime for the lightbulb. There is also graph showing breakdown of energy for producing, packaging and ""normal use"". The first two are fixed no matter how much you use the light and are lowest for incandescent. If you only use the light in that basement, you would get net energy savings after many many years of use. And the LED won't last that long because the electronics will deteriorate over time. I guess you agree that it takes more energy to produce LED bulb, right? I don't have exact numbers(I won't study the whole paper to give you exact numbers, but it's obvious from the graphs), but let's say it's 10 kWh for 60 W incandescent and 20 kWh for 10 W LED with the same output. So the net energy savings come when you use the light for more than 200 hours. If you use that particular light only 10 hours per year, it will take at least 20 years before you really start saving energy. By that time, your LED in the wet basement will have corroded PCB contacts, broken down solders(because lead-free solder - another EU regulation), leaked capacitors and for sure you won't be able to turn it on.

It went through the same thing with the crisis with Greece and the rest of PIIGS. However, decisive actions taken by the ECB and IMF then have largely soothed over those fears, however doubts still exist. The brexit poses an arguably much larger risk, simply because of Britain's economic weight within the union. If the EU does not prove to the rest of the world, without a sliver of a doubt, that staying within the union is in the interest of any of the member states, then this confidence in the euro will continue to erode. They cannot let this happen. The objective isn't to hurt UK, it's to show that leaving the EU is the horrible mistake that it truly is.

7060,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œDo you think that politicians do more wrong than right decisions?â€ that changes from time to time. For example if I look at national level, I was happy with the previous cabinet. They did more good then wrong. With the new one the opposite is true. Pretty much everything they do is exactly the opposite from what I would want them to do.With the EU I see goals that I agree with (while not always the approach they take there. In fact the approach I almost always disagree with), and goals that I completely utterly disagree with.So the answer to your question is time depended and more complex then yes or no.â€œIf so you should try to get better insights in politicsâ€ I follow politics a lot, pretty much on a daily basis. Checking all the news, following debates in the parliament and having this sorts of debates with people. So my â€œinsights in politicsâ€ are much higher than that of your average person. I am more informed then you average person and also dive into both ways of the discussion. Like on reddit that seems to have a little more left-wing audience.â€œand stop blaming professionals for doing their job and being dominzed for SOME of them doing SOME wrong decisions that soemtimes enter the newspapers.â€ You are aware that politics is also for a big part based on ideaâ€™s an opinions. Even in politics there are 2 or more sides constantly disagreeing with each other. Disagreeing is with each other is part of politics. Itâ€™s not always an exact science and there is not always an exact answer. And there are a lot lower educated people in the parliament as I am, so based on that you can also not act as if they are all â€˜professionalsâ€™.â€œYou can ask peoples for their intersets by doing plebescites. But you can't let them decide over serious matters.â€ Well some agree, some disagree. What you are talking about is basically corporatism or a system where experts / a select group of people make the decisions. That on the other hand is not a democracy. You might not be in favor of democracy but I agree with Winston S. Churchill who says â€œDemocracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.â€. In a democracy the people do decide. You then still have two forms of it, direct and representative democracy. Personally I think a mix of the two is best. Many think representative democracy is the best. However in my opinion the true representative democracy has also proven to fail What happens is that a party says one thing during complain, gets selected for it, and then does something completely different.That is why I am in favor of a combination of the two. You might be against democracy, that is fine, that might be your personal opinion. But I have to disagree. And honestly, history is not on your side on this one.â€œPeople voting bullshit in referendums do not have to carry the responebility.â€ For the most part, sure they do.â€œProfessional Politicians with name and face have.â€ How do define a professional political, and how do you know I am or will not become one? If with professional, you mean somebody who made it is work as soon as he got from school, well that are the worse. Never see how the real world work. If you simply mean, any politician (so in a politic position) then we can all be or become one.â€œThey want to keep their job FFS.â€ Ah so you mean the career politicians. Well yeah, these are the worse. A real good politicians want to do what he think is best, even if that means he loses his job. You know, like how there are also MEPâ€™s in favor of leaving. I am not saying they are all the good ones, and all those that are in favor of the EU are the bad ones. But â€˜losing your jobâ€™ or looking at your personal career should in no way be motivations in politics. If anything, that is what had made the EU so bad.â€œStronger countries have to help weaker countries.â€ That is not a fact, that is your personal opinion. Let that be very clear!Personally I have no problem with helping other countries, but it really depends on the situation.â€œThats the whole intersest in a common market. And better for the WHOLE of the peoples anyway.â€ If you are a politician of one country, your primary goal should be that country, not the world. Doing so might result in really bad policy hurting your own people.â€œThe example North Korea is plain bullsh1t. Because there are no elected politicians.â€ Just as the highest EU leaders are not elected by the people. And it was an example based on your idea that people cannot make those decisions. Look â€œHE PEOPLE CANT DECIDE WHATS RIGHT IN GEOPOLOITICAL AND MACROECONOMICAL QUESTIONS!â€. Now you are suddenly talking about electing, however if people elect somebody they still can at least indirectly make those decision. You said they were not able to do so. So yes, the NK without electing is a perfect example in a reaction to what you said!â€œAnd by the way, the rebel voters lead the principle of direct democracy/plebescites/referendums ad absurdum, and you should know that.â€ Not sure what you are trying to say here, however itâ€™s a little bid weak to consider them â€˜rebel votersâ€™ because they voted for something you did not agree on. I could just as well consider the remain voters rebel voters.â€œBritish media spread hate for the EU the whole time, not only directly before the referendum was started. You should try to compare british mainstream media with other EU-memberstates media for that issue.â€ That is strange, if I see the British media I mainly see them on the side of the remain camp. Also now. Being very critical to the experts in favor of leaving, trying to go against everything what they say. But if it comes to the â€˜expertsâ€™ that are in favor of staying that they get all the time to tell their opinion and you almost hear no critical word from the interviewer.Also after the Brexit vote you see the same. I see crying â€˜kidsâ€™ that did not want to leave and are afraid of many things (that are not even realistic.. but again no questions ask about that) and stupid Brexit voters who changed their minds or voted for completely the wrong reasons. Also statistics showing how the youth generation voted for remain, and the old ones who have the shortest to live voted for remain. I even see headlines how the old generation dragged the youth into this.That is what the media show.What it does not show (and could) are Brexit voters who are still completely behind their point that explain why they left. I donâ€™t see the statistics (a lot) that show that the youth generation had the lowest percentages of people going to vote. So in fact most of them basically are fine with it. I also donâ€™t see headlines saying â€œolder generation safes youthâ€ and I also donâ€™t see any critical word about those cry basis who are afraid about turning the their back to Europe, as leaving the EU is not turning your back to Europe.It is then also not surprising that the majority of the people were expecting remain to win. I was not.. I knew it would be close and if anything I would have put Brexit as win.So yes the media is colored, but in favor of the Bremain side, not the Brexit side. And I see the same all over Europe.â€œYou are a moronâ€ This is the typical reaction. Just claim the other side are morons, that must make me right. Just as caps, it does not make you right. Just so you know.â€œplease stop texting to me ever again. Hope is gone in your case i believe.â€ Also this says a lot. You blame me for not being informed, but you donâ€™t want to hear what the other side of the debate has to say.

And that the EU will also have negative effects of that seems to donâ€™t matter for them.â€œhe only parties who are supporting good trade agreements and the ones that want to leave the EU as well without caring about the economic consequences.â€ If you care about economic consequences you should be in favor of making a good deal. So that is wrong. And the those that want to leaveâ€¦ well again, it shows that they clearly expect the UK to do better (if they get a good deal) what indeed would proof that those parties are correct when they say they should leave the EU. Funny enough, the parties that want to give the UK a bad deal for this same reason are now also proving that they think the same. So their only reason for keeping the EU has to do with political goals they have, and nothing with good economic policy or trading with other countries.â€œWhich sounds nice if our leaders where less corrupt and power hungry. Which they aren't ofcourse.â€ You mean our national leaders. Sure they might be corrupt and power hungry, but so are the EU leaders and at least you can much better control you national leaders then you can control the EU leaders. So it still sounds good.â€œThis has been proven without a doubt by the lies of the leave campaign.â€ Not sure what lies have proven that those leaders are power hungry. But that does not really matter. I agree that there are many politicians (on both side of the debate) that are power hungry.â€œthe main reasoning being that the walloons are costing us lots of money.â€ I know. We see similar things in the EU. Itâ€™s one of the reasons that there are so many troubles in the EU. It is for that reason that itâ€™s such a good comparison. The problems in Belgium are a small versions of the problems in the EU. Redistribution of income and wealth is a bitch and only makes everybody poor.Immigration is always a hot issue in many European countries (including Belgium!), many people are unhappy about how it is arranged and EU does make most immigration laws. So obviously it is then also a part of the Brexit discussion. And especially because immigration is a hot topic at this moment with the immigration crisis itâ€™s an even hotter topic. However like I said before, leaving the EU has been a topic for many years, also before the immigration crisis and is about much more than just immigration.Is it a decision made out of self-interest.. Yeah sure. Any national decisions should mainly be out of self-interest. The UK does this because they think itâ€™s good for the UK. In the first place everybody has to take care of himself, and after that you can look at helping other. Itâ€™s even the first rule in First Aid! Wanting a different immigration policy is not always asocial. While completely off-topic that is also something you see a lot in politics if it comes to immigration. Why is being in favor of helping in the region instead of leaving everybody into your country not social? In fact I think that opening your borders for immigrants can hurt your own social system what you can also consider very a-social towards your own citizens. In addition you are mainly helping people looking for â€˜free moneyâ€™ instead of the real refugees that are likely still in the region. So if we would take this issue to your county, I know that you are supposed to say that a party like Vlaams Belang is a-social while the others are social. But of course that by itself is also debatable.But then we are going to much into national politics instead of the Brexit debate. In the end itâ€™s all about countries being able to make their own laws and other countries respecting those. You not respecting the UK making its own immigration laws is also not very social of youâ€¦ as long as the UK does not tell you what immigration-laws you have to implement.",d4si5os,d4qzxeq,4q0ei6,0.026984109,-0.946031783,Against,29-06-16

7093,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œThe way that the UK is trying to do it is. They want all the benefits of being an EU member without any of the cost. This is clearly not beneficial to EU members.â€Nonsens. The cost go into things like subsidizing things. The UK donâ€™t want to not pay, but does also not expect any UK things to being subsidized by the EU. They want to decide themselves where they put their money.So that is in no way, wanting all the benefits but none of the costs. Trading agreements (what the UK wants) are not a benefit of the EU exclusively. Basically the UK wants to make a similar agreement with the EU as it can make with any other country. And if you make a trade agreement with India (as an example) you are also not supposed to use their laws or open your borders for all Indian people.No, if anything, all the UK wants is a fair deal. Itâ€™s in fact the EU who wants to force things upon countries.That fair deal is very beneficial to EU members. Just as it is to countries like India and why such countries also made similar deals with for example Switzerland.â€œThey can think differently about it all they like, it doesn't make me wrong.â€That by itself does indeed not make you being wrong. Just as the fact that your MP not wanting a good deal with the UK makes you right.Nobody is asking to make sacrifices, they are in fact asking to not make sacrifices in any direction. Indeed make an agreements like you could also do with a country like Canadian. But here is the problem.. The EU has abused its power to ask Switzerland and Norway to make sacrifices to get the deal. Like applying to EU law and so on.So when I talk about a good deal, I just mean a fair deal where none of the parties are making sacrifices. And yes any concessions should go both waysâ€¦ So NOT like with Switzerland where Switzerland is supposed to follow EU lawâ€¦ You know, the EU is also not implementing the laws from Switzerland.If I look at what you are saying here it seems that we both agree on what is a fair deal. You only seem to not know how the EU usually makes itâ€™s deals and so why some people are asking for a â€˜goodâ€™ deal for the UK. With a good deal they mean what you consider a fair deal. Nothing more, nothing less.â€œI have a hard time telling the difference. My view is that the UK wants all the benefits of being in the EU (mostly due to being in the single market) without any of the costs (using the Euro, accepting immigrants, and so on). Not feeling like the the UK is helping much.â€ So maybe I have to come back on my previous statement and you donâ€™t seem to understand what is a fair deal. How is using the Euro, accepting immigrants and so on fair? The UK is not asking the EU to help deal with its own immigration policy, it wants to solve those problems themselves. So that is not like asking something but not returning anything for it.. Not it is not asking for help with immigration and so also not wanting to contribute to it. Same for the Euro. The UK has the pound. It has to deal with that point itself. It is not asking the EU to in any way help / support that pound, so why would it need to join in the Euro. What you are describing now are not concessions going both ways are they. Take your own Canadian example. You are not asking the Canadians to join the Euro or take your immigrants are you?They are not asking to do so. If anything.. you are asking that from the UK. You expect the UK to accept your immigrants, you expect the UK to use your currency. The UK is not asking you to take their immigrants, the UK is not asking you to take their currency! Who is now asking who to bend over backwards?â€œI never said don't like them, but I highly doubt that anyone is giving political and economic concessions to the US or Switzerland just because they like them.â€ Nobody is asking for that. People as asking for a fair trait, both ways.â€œThere's a system of trade here, which means that if I have to give up something I need to get something in return.â€ Now we are on the right track again.. But how does this fit with your previous statement of the UK having to take your immigrants and having to take your currency?â€œIf I'm Poland, why should I be giving the UK free access to my market if I can't have free access to their market?â€ The UK is asking for that.. If it wants to open its market with Poland that works both ways. Only you (and the EU) was asking for such agreements. You wanting the UK to take the EU immigrants while the UK is not asking you to take their immigrants. You wanted the UK to use the Euro, while the UK is not asking you to use the pound.â€œTwo things that the Leave camp wants to do are to not pay the EU money, and to not allow free movement of labour from the EU.â€ The payments are used for things. The UK does not only not want to pay those payments.. it does also not ask for the things being played with that money! Free movement of labour might be an issue from another perspective. You see, the problem with the EU is, that it acts as if itâ€™s one economic organization, but it is not. So I donâ€™t know what the UK will ask if it comes to free movement of labour. But if I would compare it with countries separately then the UK might be in favor of movement of labour, or against it but then both ways. So it could for example make an agreement with Switzerland to have free movement of labour both ways, while not making the agreement with Norway. It is not asking for the UK citizens to be able to work in a specific country (without visa) while it does not allow citizens form that country to work in the UK (without visa).",d4sjy67,d4qlo35,4q0ei6,0.999861303,0.999722607,Brexit,29-06-16

7100,2,Nobody_Anybody,"1)	Letâ€™s first state that while linked, immigration policy and Schengen are in basis two different things. And in the base Schengen was indeed very good, worked very well. The problem surrounding it has come from 2 aspects. The EU taking in countries that are economically to different from the rest, and indeed the immigration policy. If one country starts giving out EU passports (and it can do that), suddenly those immigrants can travel in the whole EU, making it a problem of the whole EU.so I agree that Schengen was really good, but some decisions of the EU and some countries have made it problematic in some ways. Angela Merkel said â€œWir schaffen das!â€, and by doing so, she created a problem not for Germany, but for the EU.So Schengen was good, and in the basis still is good, but also has some problems that have become more obvious in the last 1,5 year. If every country would have its own passports and you would have a Schengen agreement with countries separately, that you can also terminate it would probably work again. At the moment that Angela Merkel then says that she can handle the crisis and immigrants starts fooling your country coming from Germany then you could terminate the Schengen with that country and she might indeed handle it. Personally I am not against Schengen, I think in fact that it is really good I it is something I would like to see be there also in another union. But that does not mean you have to be blind for the problems it has.3)	â€œAlso, do you have any idea how difficult it is to change a law within a country?â€ Yes, you need a majority. Thatâ€™s it. â€œIt usually takes years of political battlesâ€. True, if there is not a majority. But the same would apply to non-committal treaties.  You would still need a majority in your national parliament to get rid of them. So if there is no majority it would still takes years. I never said that it would be too easy to get rid of them. That was more along the lines of what you said. The problem with the current system is that even if you have the majority in your national government, you can still not get rid of them. And no they are not always about different countries, but they do often effect different groups and businesses.â€œIf something like the NAFTA can be undone or renegotiated simply by a change of power in Canada's parliament, the treaty wouldn't be worth the paper its written on.â€ Then any national law is not worth the paper its written on. In the end, I find democracy more important. A system where a treaty is easier to implement (for that you do only need one majority in a country at one given time) while nearly impossible to get rid of results in less ability to change your mind and less freedom of choice if it comes to politic ideas. So it is anti-democratic. I will always defend the democracy.â€œWhat you are proposing is essentially giving the people of a country the ability to fuck over the people in another country for any reason at any time (I can sign the deal if it looks beneficial to me and then pull out of it the moment it isn't, even if it hurts the other party).â€ Wrong, what I am proposing is essentially giving people of a country the ability to prevent getting fucked over be the people in another country.Sure there might be some examples where your option would be possible.. Like when you agree to help each other and then let them first help you but when they need help you back out of it. But at the same time, if you would really do that you also fuck yourself as other countries will then think twice before making such an agreement with you (again).However in most cases a treaty will be good for both parties when it is made. In the current scenario one country can start doing something that suddenly makes it really bad for you. So they are then screwing you. You can prevent that. The example of countries suddenly starting to give out passports in a Schengen area is an example of that.This now gives you the ability to then prevent getting damaged done by them.â€œSure, you can do it, but international agreements are based on trust and credibility, and once you pull something like that once it's going to be hard to convince anyone else to work with you again. This is wishful thinking at work. â€ Indeed, that is what I said myself multiple times. That is then also one of the reasons that treaties have to be designed so they can survive for a longer time (having people be in favor of time on the long run). So more democratic. And it is also yet another reason why countries will not retract treaties all the time just because they can..... But if they have to, well then at least they have the option to.And that is exactly why it is not just wishful thinking but why it works.5)â€œI think the EU's model for immigration has not been perfect, but a hell of a lot better than any other model that has been conceived or tried. â€I think it's terrible, not helping the real refugees while creating many problems (social, economic and security) inside the EU. But of course people can have different idea's about that. That is then also the essence of what I am doing. Allowing different countries to make different laws.â€œBy the way, your model would essentially involve either deporting all foreigners out of all the EU countries or giving them some kind of special status allowing them to stay indefinitely while not allowing any new arrivals. It would basically be the visa system for every country. It'll work fine, it just won't be and open border. â€ No, it would mean every country could make it's own laws.",d4sktym,d4qkxoz,4q0ei6,1,1,Brexit,29-06-16

Its unfortunate but typical that voters get inundated with opinions more than facts, misinformation and unbalanced arguments from different  sides of any question put before the voters in any election. Part of being a good citizen is to accept your responsibility to research and wade through the various messages and sort out what is true and what is not.  Living in a democracy means accepting other citizens have the right to disagree with you, and their point of view may prevail over yours in any election. After the Democratic process takes place, the entire society must by definition accept that democracy has decided the result for all. Its often very hard to live with an election result you don't like, but that is true for everyone who lives in that democracy. A healthy democracy depends upon everyone understanding they can't always have their own way, and that all citizens have the right to vote as they choose. If you can't accept how democracy works, you don't deserve to live in one. Your hatred of Democracy and your fellow British citizens who have the right to disagree with you, makes you are an enemy of democracy, and Britain.

7132,2,Nobody_Anybody,"6)â€œPeople will only cooperate when it benefits them somehow and the moment it doesn't they will look for a way out. â€ Luckily this does not happen inside the EU.. Ah wait, it does and it did. One of the reason the EU has so much trouble getting anything done, is also because many countries disagree. Basically my model allows for countries to disagree and go's their own way where they want to, but also work together where they want to work together. That while at the same time making sure democracy is not being damaged.In a way, it looks at the EU and removes the parts of the EU that result in all the problems.â€œThe entire point of an international treaty is to prevent the countries from backing out of an agreement even if it doesn't immediately benefit them.â€ No, the entire point of an international treaty is to come to an agreement that both parties benefit from. Some treaties already have a way out, some don't. I just say they all should have an 'easy' way out. In fact he membership of the EU is a treaty! (treaty of accession) It has Article 50 as an fairly easy way out. And we can be very happy that is has that, because if it did not less countries would have joined and countries wanting to leave (and some do) but being unable to leave might eventually even result in (civilian) war.But with the EU it's pretty much all or nothing. You join the EU and get all, or you don't.. And if you make a deal with the EU it counts for all countries in the EU. With my model there is something in-between.â€œIf you allow any country to exit a treaty at any time for any reason then there is effectively no treaty. â€ I don't know if I will be ever able to change your mind.. But you clearly don't have all facts.. You have been defending the EU by saying some issues would not work with my solution while those same issues are also not working in the EU. And then now this statement.Just open your mind for a moment, then read back... Membership of the EU is a treaty.. Oke, got that? Second.. That treaty is in fact non-committal, it has Article 50 as a way out, and that only needs to be signed by the country that wants to leave so is in fact an easy way out.And now you say that a treaty that you can exit at any time is no treaty.That means the EU is not real... but you are defending the EU! That statement is in fact part of you defense.And it also shows something else. You could say.. well you see it's bad.. not the UK is leaving. But you could also see how it's extremely rare. It's the first time since even the EEC has been created. So that is about 60 years.Obviously with smaller treaties that would happen more, but it still shows that simply the ability to exit a treaty does not mean it's something countries will be doing all the time.â€œWhy should country A trust country B when they know that country B can scrap the treaty the moment it doesn't benefit them?â€ Again, with most of the treaties the hole idea is that both benefit from it. So this really only is an issue for treaties where there is some sort of insure like model.. You help me when I need help, I help you when you need help. And they is then indeed based on trust and the fact that countries benefit from being trustworthy.â€œI tell Iceland that I will buy lots of fish from them as long as they conform to my trade rules and allow me to be the only one to import cars into their country. â€ This is such a strange agreement that I wonder if you had to make it up simply to get your example to work. A more realistic treaty among the same line would be that Iceland and the US agree about no import tax both ways for fish and for cars. This already suggest that both are being imported / exported both ways. So both parties are benefiting from it. Now lets say that for whatever reason the US breaks the deal. Well then cars being imported in Iceland will get import tax again and so does the fish going to the USA. At least for the time being both countries did benefit and now they both don't.â€œThis is why international agreements are so hard to get out ofâ€ They are not all hard to get out of. I have no idea about percentages, but in fact many already have an out option, some with some clause you have to comply with, some simply by exiting.. Like membership of the EU. All I am saying is that this should be true for all treaties by default, and should always be fairly easy. I can understand some clauses about leaving in some specific cases. But in most cases it should simply be just a matter of exiting.â€œI agree that the EU is not perfect, but what you are suggesting with your model of international agreements is naive on the highest order.â€ If you mean, the ability to leave.. Well like I said, the EU treaty has that itself. If it's about making separate treaties with different countries.

7135,2,pingieking,"Except that this is EXACTLY what the UK is asking for!  What the Leave campaign wants is for British people to have free work/residence privledges in the EU and yet keep the Poles out (nothing against Poles, it's just that when I was in the UK they seem to really like picking on the Polish).  You are entirely wrong on this.I'm not.  Canadians cannot freely move to the EU and vice versa.  However, the Canadian the arrangement is exactly the one that the UK SHOULD get from the EU.  The problem is that the UK would have to leave the single market and lose financial passport rights to make this work.  The EU is fine with this, it's the UK that isn't fine with it.I don't.  The EU doesn't either.  The GBP is a thing and will continue to be a thing.  The same arrangement was made for Iceland, Sweden, and Switzerland.They're not.  What they are asking for is full access to the EU single market and only giving partial access of their markets to EU members by restricting labour movement.But the EU is one economic organization.  That was the entire point of creating the EU.This part isn't hard to figure out, since the Leave campaign was pretty explicit about this.  They don't want free movement of labour into the UK but have no problems with UK labour moving into the EU.  The EU, quite understandably, is not in favor of this idea.Sure, but this would involve breaking up the EU single market, which the UK doesn't want.I'm will flesh out in more detail why I think the Leave campaign's position is fundamentally unfair to the EU.  Here are some of what the Leave side is asking for:1)  To have control over immigration into the UK (and thus stop the EU from having full access to UK markets)2)  For UK citizens to have free immigration access to EU countries3)  To have control over EU financial markets by retaining financial passport rights4)  To have access to the EU single marketYou can see pretty clearly that #1 and 2 are fundamentally unfair to the EU when combined.  #4 is basically mutually exclusive with #1, so unacceptable for EU members.  #3 is also a terrible deal for the EU since it would involve them giving up control of their financial markets.  Imagine if the US demanded that all of Canada's banks should be based in New York and that the TSX should move to Chicago.  This is basically what the UK is asking the EU to do with #3.  The EU is understandably not happy with such an arrangement.Here's what I think the EU should give the UK in the negotiations coming up in the next two years:1)  Full free trade agreement (no tarriffs on anything going in either direction)2)  Open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland so that we don't get a replay of the Troubles (I actually don't think the UK will find this acceptable but that's their internal problem to sort out)3)  Free visiting/holiday/travel privileges and a visa system (the points system seems like a popular choice) for EU citizens who want to work in the UK, with an identical arrangement for UK citizens looking to work in the EU4)  No financial passport rights5)  No inclusion in the EU single marketThis is a deal that I think is fair to both sides.  However, the UK is unlikely to take it because they want to have financial passport rights and inclusion in the EU single market.  The EU isn't going to give that to them without demanding free movement of labour (scrapping #3), and the Leave side won't agree to that.  This is what I meant by the UK asking the EU to bend over backwards for them.  They want the EU to give up control over their financial system and make economic concessions without giving anything in return.

7145,2,pingieking,"The treaty is NOT non-committal.  I'm not sure if you actually know what the term ""non-committal"" means.  A country is either in the EU or not, and this makes the EU membership treaty entirely committal.Article 50 is the out clause, and it is an extremely complicated out clause, which is why there is that 2-year negotiation window.  I never said that a treaty cannot be exited (or at least I didn't mean to say that).  My position is that there needs to be consequences for exiting a treaty so that the if country A wants to scrap the treaty country B is protected or compensated for their troubles.  Article 50 is exactly that.If you think that the UK will simply leave the EU just by saying that they are leaving, then you are incredibly naive.  This is why the UK politicians are now is a crazy position; their voters think that they can leave and their country would just keep going on but any informed person knows that the exit process is going to be extremely complicated.This example works too.  But if you look at most treaties written around the world the US usually can't just wake up one day and decide that they are going to tax Iceland imports without any additional consequences.  They will have to activate the out clause and either go through more negotiations (which you seem to think doesn't exist) or suffer some kind of negative consequence.  In addition to that, anyone who has treaties with the US is now really nervous because the US just woke up one day and decided that it is perfectly fine with screwing Iceland.We have different concepts of ""hard to get out of"".  The EU is incredibly difficult to get out of (as it is being clearly demonstrated right now), and most treaties already have out clauses.  What you have suggested to me is that an out clause should be ""I want out, so I'm out now"", and I think that's ridiculous.  The other party has to be protected, so an out clause needs to have an advance notice and renegotiation window, along with negative consequences if a party ignores the out clause rules or doesn't cooperate during renegotiation (the 2 year cut off for article 50 is exactly this).",d4susfl,d4srx5z,4q0ei6,0.000577139,-0.998845721,Against,29-06-16

7158,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œThe treaty is NOT non-committal.â€ Well maybe the word is not perfect but honestly I don't know any word that describes it perfectly. That is why I explained it. You can get out of it just by the Parliament singing a paper that they want to exit it.That is exactly what we have been talking about. And yes, that means you are in it our out of it.â€œArticle 50 is the out clause, and it is an extremely complicated out clause, which is why there is that 2-year negotiation window.â€ It's not complicated as in that it's hard to leave. That part is just signing a paper (well 'notify the European Council)'. The two year period is there to let you sign out but still gives you the rights / and obligations of the EU for two more years so you have two years the time to set up another treaty with the EU.That period can also be extended but also shorter as it will end as soon as you have an agreement / treaty.Have a read: http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-European-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.html.â€œThis is why the UK politicians are now is a crazy position; their voters think that they can leave and their country would just keep going on but any informed person knows that the exit process is going to be extremely complicated.â€ So explain.. what part of leaving is to complicated? The extremely complicated part (if it comes to Article 50) is making the new treaty, not so much the leaving part.Article 50 however states that you basically have two years time to get that new treaty and meanwhile you will basically remain part of the EU.The treaty is not clear about how to handle if a country would not even be interested in a new treaty. But considering the UK is, this is really all it is. Article 50 simply gives the leaving country time to make a treaty.Yes making new treaties is complicated, but leaving the EU is not.. It's just 'informing the European Council'.So as an 'informed person' I know how it works. It is not really hard to be informed, just read the article right ;)â€œThey will have to activate the out clause and either go through more negotiations (which you seem to think doesn't exist) or suffer some kind of negative consequence.â€ I in fact said in my comment that usually a country would not just go out of a treaty but want to change it. That does then indeed means you go into negotiations and can take time. I have mentioned that, but we where talking about leaving, not about changing. It is true that many out clauses have (negative) consequences, but what I am saying is that in most cases this should not be the case.I also don't talk about somebody waking up one day and exiting a treaty. There is a national process going on before that.Anyway we are drifting of here or diving to much into details. The whole point was that you can (fairly easy) exit a treaty. In the EU that is almost impossible, because a majority (or all) of the member states have to agree with it. So after you have your national agreement you need to have that as well from 27 other nations. So that makes it close to impossible. In the same way there are also treaties that have extremely hard (if any) out clauses. That are the things I have a problem with. And that is why I said you should make treaties with countries separately and it should be easy to end a treaty.â€œThe EU is incredibly difficult to get out of (as it is being clearly demonstrated right now)â€ If you consider to 'notify the European Council of its intention. ' hard, then yes. Again, the hard part is not leaving, it making a new treaty with the EU. Making treaties is always extremely hard (well most of the time, and will be here). But we have been talking about leaving right, not about making one.""I want out, so I'm out now"" Whenever that is an option yes, there are situations where you might have some rules to prevent exactly the type of things you talk about. However in many cases that is not needed and even such an out clause should not be to hard.â€œso an out clause needs to have an advance notice and renegotiation windowâ€ In many cases an advance notice is a good idea, but usually that should not be to long. Maybe a month. And a renegotiation window is usually not needed at all. When you want to change a treaty you simply go talk to a country about that. You do not need a out clause for that.The 2 years period in Article 50 is indeed for negotiations. But in the end that just allows you time to make a new treaty. Again, the leave clause (article 50) is not complicated at all.You want to leave? Let us know, for that moment on we have a maximum of 2 years that we allow you to set up a new treaty with the EU while you can / have to use the current EU rules.It's really that simple and there are not really any negative consequences in Article 50 at all.So to say something positive about the EU, it's that Article 50 is pretty good. The only thing that is not clear (also not in Article 50) is if you can also stop negotiations ans just leave within the 2 years period.

7194,2,cluo40,"Sigh. I can't believe how many posts I'm seeing across subreddits about how ""Oh shit stock prices went back up. SEE? SEE? BREXIT ISN'T BAD FOR UK ECONOMY!!""The stock market is ultimately based off of investors and how they're feeling. Clearly, in the last 2 days, there's been a very strong rally worldwide with strong gains across most stocks. When worldwide stocks plummeted on Friday, nothing fundamentally had changed about most companies. Yet, they fell because of what might be called fear, volatility, political risk, etc. So now, once people have settled down a bit, many stocks that are pretty much unaffected fundamentally by Brexit will rebound back up. However, the important part is that the for UK, the fundamentals HAVE changed. The economy will struggle in the coming months and this in return will slowly adjust the stock market downwards. This isn't a massive -15% in one day adjustment but rather as the economy weakens when Brexit actually takes place (it hasn't even happened yet for God's sake), then you will start seeing more long term effects. TLDR; There are shocks and there are changes in fundamentals. We're recovering from the shock and haven't even seen price changes due to fundamentals yet since it's literally been 3 trading days. Edit: If you want to see a stock that has had a fundamental change, look at Barclays or other financial/insurance sector companies. BARC is trading around -25% still from Friday because they actually had a real hit to their price, not just a temp shock. ",d4t4nut,4qhxry,4qhxry,1.65E-05,-0.999966935,Against,29-06-16

I'm 22/m and I voted stay, near every other 22/m/f I know voted to stay, I'm a uni student and I believed in this nation. But when the votes came back 52/48 I was shocked. 'Let's fund our nhs with the money from the EU', 'let's get rid of immigrants and lower the rates they come into our country and take our jobs'. What a fucking joke. I knew my place in this society, I knew that as a student I would have to work hard - to earn my place, as did the others who wanted to stay. We knew that immigrants were not stealing our jobs - they were earning our jobs. That to want them out is a disgusting notion from a nation that was - and is still inherently racist and has been THROUGHOUT history. Those who voted to stay you have my respect, those who voted to leave (aside from those few who truly believed that England would be better off alone (because Scotland, Wales and Ireland sure didn't) before the lies about funding our NHS and cutting immigration rates were fed to us in ladles) I hope you're proud, you are all clowns. European cities lit up their momuments in a show of compassion for us to stay, European cities light up when tragedy strikes, when bombs fall and when fellow EU citizens die. We are and were undeserving of such an honor. A huge number of my friends, those close to me are of European descent, parents of whom came to Britain to WORK for a better life. As an Englishman I am ashamed to look these people in the eyes and to be frank I am not worthy to. We are a disgrace. I am wholeheartedly sorry for the mess we are in as a nation. I believed we were better than this, that Europe was our home. But we went from being in, to not wanting, to not deserving a place in Europe in the space of 24 hours. What a joke we are. Though (only just, but nonetheless) a minority of people in this country who voted stay, I would sooner renounce my English citizenship and move to any European country before staying in a country so chock full of intolerance, of racists, bigots, idiots and clowns.

7254,2,borisjohnson1901,"My Strategy to Save the UK, by Boris Johnson *The U.K. Is facing three major threats to our National Security*The first is the long term threat to our prosperity, posed by being part of an increasingly federal Europe. I truly believe that the EU needs significant reform and that it is in our UK national interest to force this reform though as a matter of urgency. I believed that a narrow victory for remain would have provided me with the fire power needed to become prime minister and I would have used the result as a stick with which I could beat Brussels to enforce speedier reform of the EU. Unfortunately, my calculations were wrong and now we have created two more, even larger short-term threats to our national security:1. The U.K. will quickly break apart because Scotland will be forced to leave our Union.2. Our citizens will face short/medium term economic disaster because prices will rise, jobs will be lost and the value of their homes will fall.But don't worry ... I can see a clear three step strategy for using our current predicament to save the UK in the short term AND reform Europe in the medium term. Everyone will be a winner (or at least a genuine majority will not be losers).*Step 1 - Win a snap general election*I want every MP who agrees that an immediate exit of the EU is a bad idea to lobby for a snap general election I want the public to support a snap general election.The crucial thing here is that this happens BEFORE MPs vote on the legitimacy of the referendum result.Once it's called I want the Guardian newspaper or some other lefty do-gooder to work with one of those progressive digital agency types to create a website that will identify every MP candidate and clearly indicate whether they will vote to ACCEPT or REJECT the referendum result and its implications. Journalists will constantly press candidates on this single issue and the General Election will serve as a second referendum.It is clear that the country is desperate to step back from the brink and therefore clear that the majority of MPs of all colours will likely opt for the position for REJECT the referendum result and REMAIN in the EU.The Labour Party are even more divided than we are and although we might have to put up with a few more UKippers in the house it will be a worthwhile price to pay because we will win and I'll be PM.*Step 2 - Using the referendum without using it*The great thing about a general election is that we can palm off the decision to 'not use' the referendum result (to enact article 50) onto the public and save face when we go back to Brussells to tell them we've changed our minds. However, crucially, we can also continue to use it to bash the Euro federalist with. Nice ;).We can avert disaster, keep our UK and go back to the safety of being in the EU with a mandate to reforming it as quickly as possible. Cool beans.Moreover, as France and other EU states run through their election processes in the coming years we will likely see more support my views from within the continent leading to more prosperity, a truer democracy and world peace. Looking good ;).I mentioned earlier that the majority will be winners. The biggest of the minority losing groups will likely be the ultra lefty federalists like the current Government in France. These are the people who will lose their dream of a federal Europe and when their elections come around their people who will have been inspired by the UKs bravery will be motivated to oust them from power and back UK calls for serious reform of the EU. Result all round :).btw. This is the main reason that France above others want us out as quickly as possible. We must resist their cunning trap!Best of all though, I will be a PM that can stay in the job for longer than a few months, the genuine majority of ordinary, decent people all over the UK will thank me for my strategy and I will be remembered by History as the man who saved the UK, Europe and the free World!*Step 3 - I'll tell you when we get there ;)*Love, Boris x[](http://coolspotters.com/files/photos/901544/boris-johnson-profile.jpg) ",NA,NA,4qfgh2,0.007820377,-0.984359245,Against,29-06-16

7322,2,pingieking,"I'm going to have to reply to you in reverse order.  Sorry for the complications.Perhaps I misread you.  My impression of your opinion was that a country should be able to just step away from a treaty with very minimal notice (like, a month or two) and then renegotiate another treaty later on.I would argue that the entire point of out clauses is to have negative consequences.  The point is to have the parties renegotiate rather than to have one party simply exit the treaty, and having negative consequences in the out clause is the best way of doing that.  It makes the exiting of a treaty a lose-lose situation, rather than country A simply fucking over country B.My point is that there needs to be an INTERNATIONAL process before that.  Lets say that country A has a national debate for two years and decides to leave a treaty with country B.  Country B would know that country A is thinking about leaving, but until country A actually informs them in a legally binding way they can't do anything about it because that would be interfering in country A's internal politics.  Therefore, it is completely unfair for country A to show up after their national debate and say ""Hey country B, we decided to leave and therefore starting tomorrow, we're done with you"".  If the out clause of the treaty is just ""Country A informs country B and then the treaty ends in 5 days"", then country B is going to get totally fucked in this case because they wouldn't be able to prepare for it.For me, out clauses should achieve two objectives:  1) To serve as a deterrent for any party to exit the treaty rather than seek renegotiation, and 2) To protect the party that doesn't want to leave so that they have a chance to minimize the negative consequences to themselves.For these two objectives to succeed, an out clause should not be easy.Now let's go back to the more specific discussion about the EU.  I think we're actually arguing on the same side but with a difference in opinion in terms of the concept of ""difficult"", or ""hard to get out of"" and language like that.The ""making of a new treaty"" is the same as the ""leaving"".  I said that a good treaty needs to have an out clause for both parties and negative consequences for any party who does not cooperate.  Article 50 almost gets it right, with the only bad part of it being that the EU has no way removing a member state, thus allowing the UK to fuck them by simply never triggering article 50.Yes, on paper the UK can decide to invoke article 50 and simply leave the union without any renegotiation, but do you actually realize what that actually involves?  Millions of citizens (both EU and UK) would have to be deported, trade would collapse almost entirely because massive tariff walls would go up, half of London would dissolve due to the lack of access to EU financial markets, Northern Ireland would descend into chaos (a replay of the Troubles) due to the borders closing.  The list goes on and on.  Leaving with no new treaty is the ""negative consequences"" that I keep talking about, while the renegotiation is the ""extremely complicated out clause"".  Sure, the UK can leave just like that, but it's going to be completely chaotic and probably get lots of (mostly Irish) people killed.Article 50 is perfectly clear about what happens in a scenario where no deal is reached - the UK would revert to a country with no treaties at all with the EU.  The relationship between the UK and the EU would revert to a ""default position"" relationships between nations based on international laws.  This means that legally speaking, the UK would be the same to the EU as, say, the USA.It doesn't look like you've actually thought about what is written.  You can quote it, but I'm not sure you realize the implications of the stuff that you are quoting.The negotiations that will take place over the next 2 years is likely going to be one of the most difficult international negotiations to take place in Europe for the 21 century.",d4te7hy,d4sx3m7,4q0ei6,0.000932494,-0.998135011,Against,30-06-16

While many are cowering in fear at this uncertain prediction, others view it as an unprecedented opportunity to free a continent from the global elite.After the world witnessed the devastating crimes against humanity demonstrated during WWII, a united Europe was seen as a preventative measure for extreme nationalism. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the EU has absorbed many independent nations since its establishment.Originally consisting of just six founding countries  â€“ Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands â€“ the EU has since grown to include a total of 28 member states, with Croatia being the last to join in 2013.[http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/about/index_en.htm]However, despite the EUâ€™s growing power and influence, the British people decided that they had had enough of the unelected global elite enriching themselves through special trade agreements ostensibly designed to bolster the economy, when in reality they merely grant special treatment to those close to the top.[http://thefreethoughtproject.com/only-the-global-banking-elite-will-suffer-from-brexit/]As reported by Matt Agorist for the Free Thought Project, the dependence of the elite on the EU was exposed when George Soros â€œtook to fearmongering about rampant financial collapse upon Brexit.â€[http://thefreethoughtproject.com/only-the-global-banking-elite-will-suffer-from-brexit/]â€œThe Brexit crash will make all of you poorer â€” be warned,â€ Soros penned in an op-ed for the Guardian on June 20. â€œMy 60 years of experience tells me the pound will plummet, along with your living standards.

7351,2,Nobody_Anybody,"With immigrants I was talking about the immigrants / refugees coming from outside of Europe in the current crisis. What you are now talking about has more to do with the free movement for working within the EU. I also addressed this but at another part in my comment.this is indeed a problem, but one that would not be a problem in â€˜my modelâ€™ because if the UK would then not want to set up such an agreement with Poland, they donâ€™t but they do set up such an agreement with for example Germany.Of course in the EU that is a problem because it counts automatically for everybody within the EU.â€œI'm not. Canadians cannot freely move to the EU and vice versa.â€ You basically where, but now you are saying something else. The way you describe it now I agree. You cannot move freely and that is both ways.. visa versa. However before you were talking about how the UK only wanted the good things but not the bad things like the Euro or accepting immigrants â€œMy view is that the UK wants all the benefits of being in the EU (mostly due to being in the single market) without any of the costs (using the Euro, accepting immigrants, and so on).â€So there you acted as if using the Euro was a cost of another EU benefit. Free movement of people might be a deal and then that is vice versa like you say not. So you accept people in and other countries accept your people. The euro is a separate thing from this and has no vice versa (get something, give something) in it.â€œI don't. The EU doesn't either.â€ Sure but that is not what you said before.. You said the UK only wanted the proâ€™s and none of the cons where you gave the euro as an example of a con. Anyway, I guess we are then now on one line about â€˜a fair traitâ€™ is.â€œThey're not. What they are asking for is full access to the EU single market and only giving partial access of their markets to EU members by restricting labour movement.â€ Well not completely, the problem with the EU is that itâ€™s everything or nothing, then it not something the UK asks that is how the EU works. I also said that in fact that is the big problem of the EU and why I am in favor of making treaties with countries separately instead of under one governmental entity (EU).â€œBut the EU is one economic organization. That was the entire point of creating the EU.â€ What does not work if you have different countries in it that have very different political, cultural and economic structures. That is also why the EU is so power hungry. In order to make this work they need to basically make that all one and the same. But most countries do not want that, they have their preferred way of doing things. And here is your key problem of the EU.When you set up a system like this all countries have to be shaped into one, and in Europe countries are too different to do so.â€œThey don't want free movement of labour into the UK but have no problems with UK labour moving into the EU. The EU, quite understandably, is not in favor of this idea.â€ You suggest they ask for that? I donâ€™t think so. I expect that they will be asking for a system where for example tourism can be without visa but and living abroad will require some requirements, like education and or having money on the bank with also the ability to (temporary) deny this for working fields that might be under pressure. With an exception for people already working abroad (EU citizens in UK, UK citizens in other countries) And of course this would then work both ways. This would imho makes most sense, is a fair trait as it works both ways, results in something the Brexit and the Bremain people should be able to live with and does not create problems for people already living / working in / outside UK.â€œSure, but this would involve breaking up the EU single market, which the UK doesn't want.â€ This was an example of a non-EU system. And that is exactly what the UK wants.You seem to be expecting the UK to ask for different things then I expect them to ask. That said, yes there would be other things they would prefer to ask (in a fair way) but the EU system makes this impossible. Like I said, you canâ€™t deal with countries inside the EU separately, you automatically deal with all of them and that is a problem because you might want to set up treaties with some of them but not with some other countries.

7366,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œI consider this a gross simplification of the political processes generally involved, but you are correct.â€ Because in most cases you donâ€™t want to just remove a law, but change it. Anyway, this is what I want for treaties as well. No treaties that have no way out or with an out clause that is basically just trying you to prevent from ending it. Sure, requiring a  notification a x time ahead or some small rules to prevent you from screwing over another country (something that imho is not the case with most treaties). But with many treaties it is very hard to leave it, and within the EU is near to impossible.â€œThe problem is that your idea of an exit clause is essentially ""because we feel like it"", and that's not good enough for any reasonable person.â€ There does not have to be a â€˜goodâ€™ reason. And â€œbecause we feel like itâ€ is in fact â€˜because democracy!â€™. By the way your statement â€œI don't deem it impossible (since I am in favor of such agreements).â€ is interesting when taking into account that this is close to impossible within the EU. One country can not himself get out of a treaty, it needs all the other countries for that, or a majority, or it has to leave the EU all together.â€œSo If I understand you correctly, the difference between your idea and the current EU is that in your scenario, agreeing to a treaty is voluntary. â€ Pretty much yes, and that also gives the ability to exit a treaty.â€œThat's fine, but everything you have suggested sounds exactly like what European international politics was like in the year 1900. I was under the impression that the EU was created to avoid exactly that, and I think that what we have now is better than that.â€ The cooperation that we have now is better, but the system is not.In the system as I describe it you could in theory get all the same treaties and deals as we have now in the EU. You probably would not. Like the Poland example from before, the UK might not have signed with Poland. But in theory you could set up exactly the same treaties.I think the big difference is that in the 1900 there was not the common idea of working together. That is why I did say you would have this one central place where you go to talk. No governmental system but just a debating area as you will. You actively join this group of countries that want to cooperate, you keep communicating with other countries. So there is always the intention to work together and I think that is a big difference with 1900.Really the only really big difference in practice is that you leave countries the ability to make their own decisions, let them be who they are. Other then that the EU is not so very different from what I say. But as soon as you set up a central governmental system like the EU you start taking away national democracy and national abilities for countries to make their own laws. Now why are many people so negative about the EU. 1 because a lot of the things they do donâ€™t work out (that is because all countries have to agree on things what is very hard) and 2 because countries have to give away power (this is a direct effect of 1. The EU wants to be able to do things more efficiently but to do so it needs more power). It is just a system not fit for Europe.That is why some people say that the EU is Anti-European.",d4tre7j,d4stuq7,4q0ei6,0.999336126,0.998672252,Brexit,30-06-16

7375,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œPerhaps I misread you. My impression of your opinion was that a country should be able to just step away from a treaty with very minimal notice (like, a month or two) and then renegotiate another treaty later on.â€You understood me correctly. It should be able to. Just as it is able to remove a law with just having a majority. That does not mean it is something that (should) happen a lot in practice. Usually a country does not just want to exit a treaty but want to change it. Then it will likely take much longer, just as changing a national law.â€œI would argue that the entire point of out clauses is to have negative consequences.â€ I disagree. I think in practice they are there for 2 reasons. To prevent the type of â€œone side screwing over the otherâ€ that you talked about. That is a reasonable one but as I said, this is not something that imho is a real issue with most treaties between countries. Usually treaties involve both parties having benefit of it. As soon as one party ends it (likely because itâ€™s benefit stopped existing) the benefits are gone for both countries but no country is truly screwed by the other one.Another reason is simply to prevent countries to exit the treaty. This is in my opinion really bad and should not exist.I donâ€™t think that an out clause it there to try two parties to renegotiate because you do not even need a out clause for that, you can renegotiate without ending the original treaty.This is in fact also not what happens in Article 50. It allows for 2 years to make new treaties with the EU, but not to renegotiate the existing one. Cameron in fact did renegotiate the existing relationship with the EU before the referendum.â€œthen country B is going to get totally fucked in this case because they wouldn't be able to prepare for it.â€ That is where the 5 days in your example are for. Now depending on the treaty that number should obviously be different. In some cases it can indeed be 5 days but in many other cases a month would do or one quarter, or something along those lines. But I always said it should be easy. Informing a country you will leave, and that taking effect a month later (or 3 months later) is still easy.Now look at the EU, you want to end a treaty. You need to get all other countries to agree with you. That is not easy, that is close to impossible. You see the difference there.And yes I did not go into those details. I also said itâ€™s impossible to leave a treaty in the EU. Of course that is also not true.. it can be done but is very hard. And when I say you should be able to end a treaty freely, that does also not mean there are no rules about it whatsoever. But in the end what I want is then when democracy in one country decides they want to get out of a treaty, they can. In the EU that is not so sure. When you have to inform a country a month ahead and that is it, then you can comply to the democratic decision made in your country.â€œ1) To serve as a deterrent for any party to exit the treatyâ€ Well and that part I completely disagree with!â€œ2) To protect the party that doesn't want to leave so that they have a chance to minimize the negative consequences to themselves.â€ That I do agree with. Just be careful itâ€™s reasonable, so that you donâ€™t have a rule with as argument your number 2, but effectively being your number 1.And I will say it again. I think for most treaties between countries this is not a real issue. When 2 countries have a treaty they both benefit, with it ends they both stop benefitting.â€œFor these two objectives to succeed, an out clause should not be easy.â€ Well only for your number 1 it does. But your 2 requires what it requires to not have one party get hurt, but that does not automatically mean it has to be hard.â€œYes, on paper the UK can decide to invoke article 50 and simply leave the union without any renegotiation, but do you actually realize what that actually involves?â€ I did not talk about things being a good idea or not, I said it should be possible. And surely with the EU you want to set up a new treaty. Nobody is arguing about that.â€œIt doesn't look like you've actually thought about what is written. You can quote it, but I'm not sure you realize the implications of the stuff that you are quoting.The negotiations that will take place over the next 2 years is likely going to be one of the most difficult international negotiations to take place in Europe for the 21 century.â€You seem to fail to realize that these are two different things. Yes the negotiations for a new treaty can take years and can be very complicated. Mainly because both parties likely do not agree about many things. But that is about how you continue after you left. Initiating the leave is just informing them.You say, leaving is hard because of the negotiations that can take 2 (or more) years. I say, the leaving part is hard, but obviously you want to set up a new treaty (Article 50 gives you time for that) and creating that new article is very hard.

A lot of companies I know are still hiring but some are doing it based on plans already in place. When it comes to the next stage they'll review their plans depending on the exit strategy that the UK puts in place. Another big aspect is all the companies have to basically say ""It'll be great, we're prepared"" to show confidence for the share holders. So it is hard to work out what their true plans are until they happen. Personally I know two major tech companies that are looking to move depending on what access the UK has to the single market. Though both in public have not mentioned or come forward with said plans. At the moment they're both continuing as usual. Incidentally the too big areas that people are eyeing up are Frankfurt and Barcelona. Some of the US clients are keen to see what happens and hope that it'll be a good time to buy up UK property and companies. Again they're only publicly saying they're 'optimistic'.

7464,2,pingieking,"Ok... so how do you propose stopping it from happening a lot in practice?  What's to stop a country from signing a deal and reneging on it a few months later once it had obtained what it wanted?  Suppose Iran had a functioning democracy, should it just be able to vote out it's nuclear deal with the US whenever it wanted to?  Should the Canadians be able to vote out NAFTA with no consequences, even though it would do huge damage to the Mexican and American economies?I would say it is a very big issue for most treaties between countries.  It's an issue with NAFTA, the EU treaty, CETA (still in negotiations), TPP ( still in negotiations), and the vast majority of treaties I've come across.  For an example that I'm more familiar with, a lot of people in the US want to kick Mexico out of NAFTA.  A lot of Japanese people want to break a trade+technology transfer deal with China.  A great example is a trade deal between Lesotho and South Africa.  Lesotho agrees to sell a certain amount of water to South Africa, which the latter uses to keep people in Johannesburg alive.  There are rumblings of Lesotho wanting to end that deal, but the out clause is deterring them from doing so.  In your model, Lesotho would be able to back out of the deal with a month's notice.  South Africa gets completely fucked because it's not possible to secure a source of water for a city the size of Johannesburg in less than several years, so the city is thrown into chaos.  This is why I think that it's irresponsible for leaders to think that their treaty partners won't have a change of heart in the immediate future.  It doesn't sound nice, but De Gaulle was right when he said that ""France has no friends, only interests"".Sure, but not without consequences (which we have established you are completely against).  I don't think the citizens of country A should be able to make a decision among themselves that would have a massive impact on citizens of country B, who gets no vote in any of this, without some kind of consequence to protect the people of country B.  I think we can all agree that to do so is somewhat unfair.That's such a naive view of how international treaties work.  In fact, that's a naive view of how most legally binding agreements in general work.  In real life, there are many deals where there is asymmetric benefits for a significant amount of time.  Think of a situation where the first 20 years of the deal country A benefits while country B loses, and then country B benefits while country A loses for the next 20 years.  These types of deals are pretty common.Lets look at an example.  China and the EU came to an agreement for Airbus to build a giant factory in China, and in exchange Airbus agreed to give the Chinese technical training and access to European aerospace technologies.  In the treaty there are built in consequences for either party to back out.  It doesn't make it impossible, but it does serve as both a deterrent and protection for the parties involved.  In your opinion, the out clauses should not have any consequences.  So what is there to stop the Chinese from backing out of the deal the moment they get their hands on the technology?  Why should the Chinese not kick out Airbus once they have the technologies and set up their own company to undercut Airbus on the international market?  They might lose EU's business and get some bad press for it, but now they can build planes that are as good as Airbus and do it at 70% of the price!  The EU accounts for less than half of the world's airplane business anyway, so this is a net win for China.  I hope you can see how this situation would be unfair to the EU and Airbus.Well it certainly can't be easy.  Otherwise how does it prevent the other party from being hurt?You're arguing exactly about that.  You think the 2 year window shouldn't exist, and I think it should.They are different on paper only.  Realistically, they are two parts of the same thing.This is the part you don't get.  Even if no new treaty is signed at the end of the 2 year period and the UK leaves without a new treaty, it doesn't mean that no rules apply to the relationship between the EU and UK.  There are still technically treaties in effect, and those are based on rules set up through organizations like the UN and WTO.  Legally speaking the ""leaving"" bit is easy, but to actually do it is incredibly difficult.  Legally the British can just informs the EU and wait for two years.  But to actually do it involves millions of pounds spent on new agencies, new laws, deporting people, closing borders, moving companies in or out of the country, and the list goes on.  All of this is assuming that they don't negotiate a new deal and simply leaves, which you describe as the ""easy"" part.",d4u0999,d4tsa5v,4q0ei6,0.76708967,0.53417934,Brexit,30-06-16
7465,2,spelaccount,"Thanks for this text, very informative! You must understand that i am an outsider to the whole brexit thing but i try my best to keep as good informed as possible.I get what you mean when you say that Cameron promised an election, but isn't the whole point of a democracy to give the majority what it wants? I think it a bit unfair to blame Cameron for the people's vote. It's a bit like saying your friend is to blame for your drug addiction, since he gave them to you. Of course he has a play in the whole, but it was you who chose to use them.Yes he did not want the UK to leave the EU, but as a president of a democratic country he is obligated to do two things: actions which are good for the country, and actions the majority of the people want you to make. Those two unfortunately are not always the same actions. As a politician, your job is to try to make the people as happy as possible with your choices to do the best job you can for your country, but in Cameron's case it seems like this was not an option. He wanted A, while the people clearly went for not A.I still feel it would be a weird choice when Cameron would have decided to stay after the people made it this clear they don't stand for the same idea's as he has.Also i think it's very brave when people with his kind of power dare to accept they no longer can control the situation. However as a president, you can then decide to stay in charge, whilst admitting you can control the situation, or give the job to someone who claims (s)he can, and has the peoples support.Regarding the very interesting comment you posted:What i read is that firstly that would be very disadvantageous for the people of England to trigger art. 50. So badly that, in fact, that it would end the candidacy of whichever president is in charge.Now put yourself in Cameron's shoes, what would you have done? He feels that triggering art. 50 is a bad move for his country. Isn't it logical that he would try any way to not trigger it?Now put yourself in Boris Johnson's shoes.

7471,2,pingieking,"I never said that you need a reason to exit a treaty.So you are advocating for one group of people (citizens of country A) to make or change rules that would apply to another group (citizens of country B) without any input from the second party?  Doesn't sounds terribly democratic to me.Remember, I'm not saying that countries should not be able to leave treaties.  I'm saying that they can leave, but will have to deal with legal consequences.The EU is not made up of hundreds of treaties.  The way that the EU is set up is that there is one giant treaty (EU membership) and a whole lot of smaller ones that are legal attachments to the big one.  The reason that a country cannot back out of the smaller ones is that they are technically not stand-alone treaties; they function as additions to the one big treaty and therefore the only way to not obey the little bits is to back out of the big one.  So no, it's not ""impossible to leave a treaty with the EU"", it's just not possible to decide not to obey a specific part of the treaty.  I happen to think that this is a necessary evil and in general does more good than harm.  You disagree.Much of the current cooperation we have now is due to the EU system's coercion.  If you really think that Spain and UK can cooperate effectively without the EU as the big brother looking over their shoulder, then you clearly haven't looked at the Gibraltar issue.  Problems like those are littered throughout the continent and are terribly difficult to navigate around for individual nations.  If you think that individual European nations are going to cooperate more than they did throughout history, then I'll just have to call you naive and leave it at that.I highly doubt the ""intention to work together"" will last long without the EU forcing everyone to work together.This is the necessary evil part of the EU.  To be in the EU a nation has to give up part of its sovereignty rights.  It doesn't take away all democratic power from the people, but it does dilute the amount of power that they do have.  I see this as a necessary move to keep Europe from fighting each other the way they use to, because now there can be more pressure from the other 26 countries to make the two troublemakers behave.  If you think that the partial loss of sovereignty is not worth the improved cooperation and preventing conflict in Europe then we'll just have to disagree on that.",d4u17gp,d4tre7j,4q0ei6,0.95107587,0.902151741,Brexit,30-06-16

That's what Asset Managers or Hedge funds with billions or even trillions of dollars of liquidity do. We're market makers that profit off commission from hedge funds and other investors that are trying to make these trade. Every position that we do hold, is very carefully and often times algorithmically hedged to ensure no large losses are taken. In essence, we don't really gamble because that's not our job. To touch on your about the polls, I was tracking polling very carefully up until brexit. Initial polling data has always been very inaccurate due to biases between the voter groups.

This was simply the market factoring in the expected probability of the Brexit reform passing or failing. As soon as information started being released, the market corrected itself in 2 bursts of roughly 5 minutes each time. This is also why it was so surprising that Brexit had actually passed because most people weren't expecting it at all. You have a good point in that people don't only look at finance. This is true and I mentioned initially is that what Brexit boiled down to for me is: ""Is it worth it to take a hit to our economy in exchange for freedom?""

As far as I can remember I have never said that I wanted free labour movement between the EU and countries outside of the EU system.The Euro can be both a cost or benefit, depending on the country and situation.  Germany clearly benefits, as does France, Belgium, Netherlands, and so on.  Greece was benefiting until they borrowed stupid amounts of money using Germany's credit rating and defrauded the EU.  There are both positives and negatives to the Euro, which is why some EU countries decided not to use it.  This isn't an issue for anyone.The UK sees the Euro as a con, which is true for their specific situation.  It's still not an issue though, since neither the UK nor EU care about this.  I don't care about this either, and I never said that I wanted the UK to use the Euro.  No idea where you're getting this from.I don't just suggest that, I say that this is a fact.  If fact, Boris Johnson clearly said that this is exactly what they want.  This is a quote of what he said:Source:  http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/boris-johnsons-brexit-plans-for-free-movement-for-brits-but-controls_uk_5770c7dfe4b08d2c56396ee6This is the one I found just now, but there are other more credible sources if you want to look for it.This is Boris Johnson saying that he wants UK citizens to have free access to the EU but not for EU citizens to have free access to the UK.  Doesn't get more official than that.You are wrong.  The UK DOES want a single market for the EU, and they also want access to that market.  See citation above.  Every single one of the Leave campaign leaders have said in one form or another that they want the EU single market to stay together and that they want to have access to that single market.Yeah, that's because I'm basing it on what the Leave campaign says they want.  You really need to read a bit about what the Leave campaign people are saying before you start talking about their positions on policies.They only need to have the same immigration and market policies.  Individual nations can have their own social laws and international cooperation agreements (as long as it's not an economic agreement).  The EU is not actually that power hungry.  It has, and needs, significantly less power than any federal government.  You might think that's too much, in which case we'll just have to disagree.It's actually far more of a problem for Poland than the UK.  It's important that if the UK has access to Poland's market, then Polish people need to have the right to work in the UK.  If Poles can't move to the UK what will happen is a massive movement of money from Poland into the UK as British companies set up factories in Poland to take advantage of cheaper wages and take the extra profits back to the UK.  If a poor country give free access of their market to a richer country but doesn't get the right for their citizens to move to the richer country for higher pay, it is effectively a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich.  This is why the UK isn't going to get what they want because the poorer countries in the EU would never agree to it.It's worked a lot better than the alternative.  Your proposal would result in there being no Europe except in a geographical sense.

7568,2,Nobody_Anybody,"â€œOk... so how do you propose stopping it from happening a lot in practice? â€ I talked about this before. In practice I don't think it will happen a lot, just as most national laws don't get removed on a daily basis. Usually both parties benefit from it. Also the idea that one party benefits from it for a very short term and then exits it screwing the other is not a likely scenario. And yes for Iran the same holds true. I mean you can trust them or you can't. The treaty is not going to change that.For the NAFTA example you again have that both parties benefit. So there is not a lot of reasons for the Canadians to go out, if anything they would want to go into negotiations to change it. But yes if they want to there should be the ability without an extremely hard out clause. Just a reasonable one.â€œa lot of people in the US want to kick Mexico out of NAFTA â€ Honestly, then they are not very good deal.. And how is it possible that you have such a bad deal? Because those in favor know that getting out is close to impossible anyway so when they had the ability to sign it they did not having to care about what the people did think about it in the long run. Undemocratic is hell.In fact it is funny that you mention CETA and TTIP. Those are not even here and by everything that is known for it, a huge population is already against it. The EU on the other hand is planning on pushing it forward anyway, there has literally been talked about speeding up the process. You know why? Because they expect more parties that are against them to come to power in the coming years, so they want to push it in before they get to power.Now there is the perfect example of why I find it... no why it is so undemocratic to now be able to get out of it.If it would be 'easy' to get out of it, this type of undemocratic nonsense would not be possible because they had to make a treaty they know would be in favor by the people in the long run.â€œSouth Africa gets completely fucked because it's not possible to secure a source of water for a city the size of Johannesburg in less than several years, so the city is thrown into chaos. â€ This is a very specific example, but then I would still be in favor of having the ability to get out. Only the out clause has then to include a way to prevent deads. Like they should find a way to get the water anyway.I don't know about this deal a lot so will not go into details as that would involve to much guessing.â€œwithout some kind of consequence to protect the people of country Bâ€ If there would be a direct hit on one country, if the other leaves then the out clause would indeed have something in it to lower this as much as possible. But imho in most cases it will be a lost in both directions that might level each other out.And you keep forgetting that when it is hard, the opposite it true. A country can come into a situation where they are not benefiting from a deal or even having negative effects by it while the other country is benefit ting from it. In your solution (or like it is now) it can then be close to impossible to get out of it. How it that in any way more fair then when the other get a negative effect from you leaving. So the way it works now does not really prevent one party from getting hurt, it just works the other way around.. Now a country can get hurt because it's unable to leave / exit a treaty.â€œWell it certainly can't be easy. Otherwise how does it prevent the other party from being hurt? â€ Well it certainly can't be hard, Otherwise hoe does it prevent the party being hurt from keep being hurt?We had the immigration example where you have a treaty with one country for free movement of about, and then suddenly the other country start giving out passports resulting in a flood of people coming to your country decreasing average income. But in the current and your scenario there is no easy way out.â€œou're arguing exactly about that. You think the 2 year window shouldn't exist, and I think it should. â€ I never said that. I said it should be easy but it has to be fitting to the treaty. The membership of the EU might be the biggest treaty in the world as it in reality are basically hundreds of treaties pact together.â€œThis is the part you don't get.â€ Let me put it in another way. Article 50 is more about the process of making a new treaty then it is about leaving. The 2 years are there so you have time to make a new treaty. There is not some heavy clause preventing you form leaving. You don't have to pay billions, or get all countries to allow you to leave or anything like that.",d4ufg80,d4u0999,4q0ei6,0.999999727,0.999999453,Brexit,30-06-16

If we do this, the GBP will drop with 1 billion. I think more people would have voted for a Brexit then they did now. As many will say.. Well the addition freedom is worth that 1 billion.And in a way that '350m' was not about the number, but about the ability to decide yourself where you put that money. You see, it was debunked by saying â€œan x amount comes backâ€ resulting in a lower nett payment. But even if it comes back, the EU is deciding where it is going to. And that is even more what it is about. So even if you now still lose 100m (because of  a bad economic situation) you at least decide yourself where you spend the other 250m.People did not vote for Brexit, hoping for an better economy, while many probably do think it might also result in a better economy in the long run.",d4uge8o,d4u1l9l,4qlg3f,0.002102281,-0.995795437,Against,30-06-16

And if there was a law like that on the books it would likely be the first law to ever be repealed with more than 100% agreement.Anyway for a quick example of how wrong-headed the idea is:http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/137-article-50.htmlThat's directly from Article 50 which specifically lays out what happens if the exit negotiations fail: the state that invoked article 50 is out anyway, agreement or not. Article 50 obligates the EU to enter into negotiations with an exiting member, no more. The negotiators can sit around the table twiddling their thumbs until 2 years are up if they want to.That said, economic interests mean the EU will likely negotiate a trade agreement with the UK, but it will hardly be on favourable terms. The UK has a very weak position for negotiations and a lot of EU members are kinda pissed at the favourable treating they got all the time and are likely not willing to be generous.",d4uglad,d4u263q,4qlg3f,0.004195449,-0.991609102,Against,30-06-16

And for me personal that is interesting. I did expect a hit on the short run. So I am not trivializing it, but it did simply not really shock or surprise me.â€œJust because they're predictions and not ""fact"" since they haven't happened yet doesn't make them any less important. â€That is true..

7621,2,TimS_Newcastle,"EU referendum- The ideological argument was not lost. it was not made. EU referendum- The ideological argument was not lost. It was not made. With heightened emotion in recent days I hope to convey some thoughts and also to purge myself of some frustration. Disbelief and disenchantment have pervaded for myself like many others since the referendum result. With a sense of indignation I expelled these emotions to friends and family and was met with an equal lassitude. With the clarity of reflection I failed still to believe that 52% of the population had voted in a way that was so abstract to my own ideologies. I was left incredulous when a friend attempted consolation by posing that the economy would recover and that it were unlikely to have much tangible effect on my day to day life. It dawned on me, the miscarriage of justice that this referendum campaign has reaped. An inept campaign which lacked respect for the intelligence and ideals of this country and opened the door for opportunistic demagogue alternatives. A campaign run on its narrow sighted obsession with the economic ramifications in such a way that would lead you to believe that each individual is this country I love is presumed to be a bastion of selfishness only concerned with their immediate surroundings. Even their prized nonetheless legitimate economic argument they failed to deliver successfully. The individual who suggested I should not fret had no insight into the source of my regret. We are not mourning a downgrading of our credit rating, the pound devaluation against the dollar or the uncertainty of our financial future. Yes these economic factors cannot be overstated in their far reaching consequences and fill me with fulminant concern and uncertainty, however this is not the cause of mine and many otherâ€™s bereft state. We are mourning a potential lost ideology or at least a setback in its progress, a fervent belief that Europeâ€™s dark days of nationalism, xenophobia and disunity are behind us and that this world is moving in the right direction to a future worthy of pride. A political union of countries across the European continent, yes it started as a trade deal and became so much more. This was so often used as a tag line by the Brexit campaign, but that is the soul of my argument, it became so much more! A political union of democratic countries that have overcome what for so long has been the hamstring of nation democracies, brevity of election cycles, vacuous vote winning policies and a vulnerability to the will of large corporations with only capitalist ideals. It has achieved the collaboration of minds, ideas, hopes and dreams of the peoples of one of the most culturally diverse areas in the world and given them a platform to bring these to fruition in an arena where long term thinking is possible, an arena where profit margin is not the overarching common denominator but liberalism, human rights and liberty take the forefront. Furthermore this organisation is inclusive inside the EU and without, it celebrates our differences and our shared values and looks to speak on a world stage for these values. We live in a global society and we share our beautiful planet and only through international collaborative political unions do peace and environmental protection have hopeful outlooks. Just like the men, women and children who hear the cry of our European values and look for reprieve from war, violence and despotic rule and naturally seek refuge under our aegis, they also learn that it is possible and this gives hope for change for many regions around the world and the ascension of these shared human values. We have an unimaginably privileged position and the responsibility to advocate for those who are less fortunate. Together we are far more effective at setting that example. We must not forget that it is still in the living memory of many that Europeans were looking to others for refuge from a tyrant who brought war and violence to millions in the name of hate and it was for this very reason that the European Union was born.I cherish the diversity in this world and encourage the realisation of our shared futures. 52% of the British population did not vote for nationalism, xenophobia and disunity. 52% of the population are not the epitome of selfishness. Austerity measures since the global recession have been necessary yet too often severe and disproportionate in their effect on often the poorest communities. Inequality remains a colossal problem even within our developed nations and with increased transparency we have seen successive politicians setting poor examples aspiring to their own career ambitions and self-preservation rather than using their privileged position to represent others. The remain campaign underestimated the innate nature of the British people and failed to educate on how this union stands for so much more than a free market.  The irony of the vote to leave is that many of the areas who voted most passionately for this in the hope of change are the very type of areas that the EUâ€™s rebate budget has begun across Europe to invest in, in an attempt to re-ignite local trades and economies that have struggled following changes to industry and are too often neglected by their domestic nation financial hubs.The European Union was initially supported by the elite right wing due to the promised free market and increased profit potential yet as it has evolved, as it has begun to enshrine in law workerâ€™s rights, consumer rights and environmental protection it is this very right wing elite that have opportunistically run a disingenuous mercenary campaign to leave the union and convinced people to vote on false pretences. The free market opportunities are growing yet their inflated personal margins are threatened as attempts are made to reduce inequality and ensure the end of poverty in our continent.Nationalism was a tool used by sovereigns to enslave the masses and further their own agenda. In the twenty first century we need to redress the core meanings of liberty and sovereignty. As a member of the European Union I feel as individuals we are freer and our state by being a member of such a political union is more democratic secondary to the aforementioned overcoming of the hamstring of nation democracies. We have much to be proud of as British citizens yet regrettably there is much in our history that was done falsely in the name of sovereignty and nationalism that is worthy of shame. What we have achieved in the EU as a member state in the last fifty years will not be forgotten and it is these shared achievements which the United Kingdom has taken leading roles in that fill me with pride of our country, our continent and the wider human endeavour for progress.

7644,2,Kosteevo,"The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter - Winston Churchill. So when does nationalism become bigotry and xenophobia? When does wanting the best for your country come before inclusion with others? Thereâ€™s a fine line. Too much passion normally leads to anger and violence when you feel impotent. An almost fanatical level of belief that the â€˜insert race hereâ€™ are after our jobs and money and houses; all of which festers and grows like an untouched spot filling with pus and bile. Before too long it gonna explode, and there will be a mess.  Brexit has already turned this in to the divided kingdom with people just living off the fantasy of the savage times when we plundered our way across continents; the times when things like ships were the main war machine and we were the only ones with guns. Or is it just an overreaction? Is Britain actually a major financial and engineering powerhouse that the world needs? Letâ€™s examine. The news will always cherry pick the voice it wants to and spread their own message, unchecked as it may be. They feel itâ€™s their job to speculate, not inform. However, people are contacting the voting registry to see if they can change their vote; or indeed vote. These are the kind of feeble brained twatpuffins who make it feel like we should have an IQ test before people are allowed to both vote and mate. Multiple news stories are already building about many people who use phrases like â€œI think I should of thought it through some moreâ€. Really? Are you sure thatâ€™s what you think? Did you think about that? You think maybe you should have put some thought into what happened in your country for the foreseeable future?  Probably, but you just went ahead and voted anyway. â€œI didnâ€™t think weâ€™d win, so thatâ€™s why I voted, I wish I could change it nowâ€ states a young lady. Itâ€™s starting to become more clear that itâ€™s probably a good move that we are separated from the EU as all weâ€™d do is drag down the intelligence levels. One man who adds strength to the get away from them to keep an element of dignity party is Mr Nigel Farage. Mr Farage is the arrogant walking pint of smug piss that leads the United Kingdom Independence party (UKIP), and he spoke to the European Council for the 1st time since the vote to leave. He stood tall as he told them how he told them so 17 years ago and how none of them are laughing now, that none have ever done a dayâ€™s work or created a job in their lives. He sneers at them. Smug like a child whoâ€™s mummy has finally told him he was right and heâ€™s going to let everybody know. My heart is crushed with every word from this reprehensible creature. The shame I feel in my country increasing as he is how we are portrayed now. A combination of arrogant xenophobic idiots and football thugs.  I want to slink away into a dark corner. Surely we could have stopped this? Just a billboard or a bus with; Do you want this egotistical bigot to be your loudest voice?  Vote remain. Heâ€™s roundly booed. I feel like I could walk around the assembly and make good money by selling various fruits you can throw at this preening peacocks head. He then follows that up by telling everyone â€œwe need to be mature in these negotiationsâ€, with a sense of irony or dignity utterly absent. Jebus. Get this self loving oaf out of there. The last thing we want to do is antagonise everyone that we will have to write and agree new deals with, at least not this early. I wouldnâ€™t be stunned if he dropped trou started spanking his ass and blowing raspberries at everyone. Mr Farage is a man who is desperate to be seen and heard, the kid who was always picked on. He is one of the main men who said all the money we give to the EU a day (350m, allegedly) should be used on the NHS. Literal hours after the vote, he said that claim was â€˜a mistakeâ€™, a mistake that he made for over 2 months while campaigning; a mistake that was a deciding factor in the outcome. He is a mistake. One made by two people no doubt not realising what they had unleashed on the earth. Iâ€™m sure we can bring back the stockade. In fact Iâ€™m sure that would bring some good income into the country. Roll up; roll up, just a pound to throw 5 pieces of old furry soggy fruit at Nigelâ€™s soggy face. Hopefully it would be a metaphor for the way lots of people feel. Thereâ€™s your billboard.  Soon every promise made during the leave campaign has been removed and denied by those who campaigned for them with such vigour before, all within hours of the votes being counted.This doomed Kingdom is cracking up. The leading parties are all imploding. As if the bottom has been kicked from underneath them, they fold in on themselves like buildings primed for demolition. Leaders are being attacked if they donâ€™t get out first. Itâ€™s a free for all. There appears to be an old law that implies that Scotland can veto the vote. You know, that crazy kind of law that still exists that no one knows about, like you can be hung for defacing a swan or beheaded for treason if you wipe up your jizz with a banknote. . If the Scottish can somehow manage to overrule the result then the North (where the majority of the people who voted to leave reside) would surely be lined up the next day, wild-eyed along the border with shovels and pickaxes, hacking at the dirt to send them adrift and make sure no one else gets in. No real sight towards the future, but they sure as hell know where theyâ€™re going, to take back the country. Are youâ€™re not needed thank you. These are the kind of people who would bite off their own hand triumphantly so they donâ€™t have to shake yours.Englandâ€™s on Fire, Europeâ€™s state is terrified. Thereâ€™s more interviews on the news, Jesus how much news can I watch? Iâ€™m hooked. Maybe nothing else is on. Who am I kidding? Everyone rubbernecks to see an accident that they are not involved in. Is this a country crash? Itâ€™s almost surreal watching it unfold. A few years ago we had some riots and as I watched crazed people, who just needed to be heard, smashing 7 shades of hell out every shop front, hell everything; all the time swigging heavily from stolen bottles from the supermarket on the corner. It was so surreal your brain almost didnâ€™t grasp the full gravity of the situation; until someone threw a Molotov into an abandoned car and set it alight. I stepped out to join the looters, scarf up around my nose, hood up. Cigarettes are fucking expensive, if I can get a nice looting discount this may not be such a loss. As I got close, running down the street and screaming wildly was someone with planes in both hands. Yep, planes used for shaping wood. He was waving his arms like a psychotic Tazmanian devil. I headed back home. I wasnâ€™t armed enough for this shit. Especially not to have half my face planed off. As I stepped in I gathered every hammer or thing that could do damage and placed them by the door. I wasnâ€™t going quietly. All that happened in a few hours, this is unfolding over a number of years. Like youâ€™re watching the crash and as you try to shout, but you canâ€™t. Your mind is already conjuring the dystopian future. On the news there are 2nd generation immigrants saying how they want all the immigrants to go home, with no sense of irony in his words. Youâ€™ve got to wonder if he watches himself later and how he reacts. Is he happy? Proud? Like he stabbed a knife into the heart of those immigrants? Now they know how this country feels.

7653,2,captain_blackadder,"Some letters from the Telegraph ""SIR â€“ Many, if not all, of the benefits of the EU that the Remain campaign championed are desirable. Few, if any, require a supra-national layer of government to achieve them.Other countries in the world co-operate and trade without such an expensive and bureaucratic organisation as the EU subverting their sovereignty. Furthermore, the EUâ€™s political ambitions are increasingly creating tension between member states, and antagonising neighbours.There has been a wave of exaggerated condemnation and panic in parts of the media about the referendum result. This shows complete disregard for the majority view that the UK should leave the EU. The short-term market turbulence is caused largely by the markets betting the wrong way, rather than any principled objection, and it will soon settle down. Then we will be able to focus on building a better future for the UK outside the EU.Once negotiations are concluded, I hope that our Scottish friends will look at what has been achieved and decide to remain in the UK.It is also to be hoped that other countries in the EU will follow the lead of the UK. All European nations could then come together in an association of goodwill, co-operation and free trade, without an additional layer of government.I voted Leave. I am neither a racist nor a simpleton, and resent the daily implications to the contrary. It is time for us all to embrace our decision and move forward.""""SIR â€“ I deeply resent the suggestion that Leave voters were mainly elderly, under-educated, racist bigots, or the marginalised poor.Those known to me are solidly middle-class, middle-aged and well-educated. Our reasons were not mainly to do with immigration but with sovereignty, self-governance and deep reservations about the long-term viability of the EU experiment.""""SIR â€“ I have never been a supporter of Ukip, but I watched with pride Nigel Farageâ€™s defence in the European Parliament of the result of the referendum. There were boos and jeers, but also cheers and applause from many when he illustrated the many flaws of the European Union and the reasons Britain voted to leave.""""SIR â€“ Already, there have been calls for Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria, France and several others to hold EU referendums. A recent poll in Denmark found only 44 per cent of the population would vote to remain.Britain should set up a North Atlantic Free Trade Association for countries to join as they leave the EU, inviting Canada, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland to join us as founding members.The only way to reform Europe is to start again, with the principle that free trade is the birthright of every nation and does not require the sacrifice of sovereignty or political freedom.""""SIR â€“ Mr Huntâ€™s idea of negotiating a new deal to stay in the single market and then hold a second referendum has all the hallmarks of a stitch-up designed to keep Britain in the EU. What question had he in mind for a second referendum?I hope the British people have sufficient nous not to be dragged into any second referendum stunt â€“ as happened in Ireland â€“ but to continue to press hard for Britainâ€™s earliest possible exit from the EU.""""SIR â€“ Jean-Claude Juncker, the President of the European Commission, has said that â€œthe British vote has cut off one of our wings, but we are still flyingâ€. Presumably the direction is round and round in circles.""""SIR â€“ I travelled by train through Europe as an 18-year-old in 1959. To all of us young people then, Europe was a continent that we were part of. We didnâ€™t feel any different from any other young people.By forcing us to be â€œoneâ€ the EU has done more to divide us than unite us.""""SIR â€“ An email that I received early on Friday from a dear Swedish friend said it all: â€œWhat you have done will mean so much for so many, and gives us all hope that democracy will survive and is stronger than all those who wish to control us. Thank you.â€",NA,NA,4qnc5a,0.706523253,0.413046507,Brexit,30-06-16
7654,2,sjbeale,Brexit: 5 Steps for Young People to Remain in the EU  ,NA,NA,4qnfkh,0.453923244,-0.092153513,Neutral,30-06-16
7655,2,sjbeale,"Brexit: 5 Steps for Young People to Remain in the EU After Brexit, steps for young people to remain in the EU are most definitely at the top of many people's minds. Given the UK EU referendum results, many young people have been left with the question mark of what to do next to remain part of the European Union.Below are 5 steps young people can take today to remain part of the European Union in various different ways.#1. Sign the petition for a second referendum.Hopefully, about this and what it is asking for, namely to hold a second EU referendum in the UK given the turnout was below 75% and the result was less than a 60% majority. The petitioners recently hit four million signatures and it is by far the biggest petition in history of online government petitions in the UK.Despite mixed parliamentary responses to it , it is still the most direct form of action you can take in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result.Remember that you need to confirm your email address before your signature is validated on the petition so make sure you check it clicked the link and it will all be done.You can also share this via social media with all your friends and email even people who you think voted to leave because they might have changed their minds, a feeling now known as â€˜bregretâ€™.#2. Ask your MP to block the Brexit in the House of Commons through Breentry.Referendums are not legally binding in the UK and a vote to agree to the UK leaving the European Union is likely to go through the House of Commons. Sign the petition to ask your MP to do all that they can to democratically block any votes or motions on Brexit. Concentrated targeting of MPs can have a huge impact on the outcome of a vote as all MPs should be representing their constituents before all else. One website that has come into being in the last few days is Breentry, which allows people to email a pre-written message to the local MP in seconds.This is a very easy and direct solution and is strongly recommended if you feel passionately about the remain vote or potentially trying to stop the UK leaving the European Union. This can help to target enough MPs to show them that their constituents do not want Brexit to happen.If you are not sure who your MP is, it will tell you this by simply clicking on the area you live in from the drop down list on the web page.  Make sure you share on social media with the most popular hashtags at the moment, such as #Brexit, #breentry, #eurefresults, #farage and any others that you see fit.#3. Investigate heritage or naturalised citizenship options either for the EU or other friendly countries.If you feel that the Brexit it is very likely to happen and that you are planning to live abroad anyway you may want to start looking into visas for other potential countries.The Irish Embassy has already received a massive upsurge in British citizens looking to become Irish citizen through the visa process. With the Scottish looking to go independent of the United Kingdom in a likely referendum result in the future , there may also be the option of going for a Scottish citizenship or passport even in the near future.If you plan to live in an EU country, Germany appears to be a safe bet given the strength of its economy, development of its industries and infrastructure and also its democratic ways and lesser corruption than many other countries in Europe. Germany is also appealing for students of engineering given its reputation in the field.Although countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy are appealing for both their weather and culture, massive amounts of bureaucracy and corruption are definite elements that may disrupt anyone planning to become a citizen in those countries.That is not to say that you should not do it, simply that it is a part of life in those countries, coming from someone who has lived in both Spain (2 years) and Italy (1 year).#4. Start learning the language of your chosen country if you want to leave.This is a natural continuation from the above point about moving to another country in Europe (excluding Ireland). But be aware that most countries will require a minimum language level and will likely ask you to . This is something that is also required for People moving to the UK. You will probably want to familiarise yourself with the CEFR, Common European Framework of Reference.  This has all language levels across the board from almost zero to native-speaker like fluency.If you find out online the level that you need you can start to learn that language today in preparation for your move. Obviously, this may seem like a bold step but in many ways it should not be as big a deal as it appears that you will still have the movement to travel around 27 EU countries.It is also likely that favourable terms with the UK will be agreed for EU citizens given its continuing role in Europe regardless of any political events in the near future.Websites like Quizlet and Linguistadores are 2 very useful resources to start you learning a language from scratch.  You may also be interested in the book Fluent in 3 Months what details and intensive language learning method for any language.  Another thing you can do is to find language meet ups in your area to start having three and informal conversations and chat on a regular basis to improve your spoken level in that language.If you have no experience of language learning, do not be afraid!  If you have learnt English as a baby, you can learn a language as an adult. In fact, it is a common misconception that children learn languages with more ease than adults. More accurate is that children are used to trying and failing and simply learning from this without judging it to be a negative, where as adults are afraid to try and therefore do not fail quickly and do not learn in the same way. Motivation to get started is also key, so if you can master up that motivation to learn a language you are well on your way to making it happen.#5. Apply for an internship or Erasmus programme in your chosen EU country.Internships not only give you practical experience in a professional field, but they also allow you the opportunity to live and work abroad in the country that you may feel suits you. There are many, many or internship opportunities available and although they do not pay, if anything at all. However, the cost of living in most European countries is cheaper than the UK, despite the drop in the pound to Euro exchange rate since the Brexit.These internships may not be available in two years time and they may also be no longer offered do British citizens prior to the Brexit happening. Therefore, it is key that if this is something that appeals to you, start making enquiries about it today as time will move fast and you will need to organise your life in order to be able to make that move.There are many websites which cater specifically to finding internships in other EU countries and helping people to do this. If you are at university, Erasmus is a fully funded exchange program that can also allow you to travel and study  in the European Union while also progressing with your degree. Again, this will serve to give you not only the experience in Europe but also boost in your language level and it will allow you to have a build up contacts and referees for your chosen country.  Regardless whether you do an internship or take part in the Erasmus programme, if you decide to work in that country in the future, having a professional referee from that area will provide you with a reference. This will give you a major boost in your job applications in future and provide confidence for you to look to getting a job there.#Summary If you have any questions about any of the points above, follow me on Twitter @stephenbeale and ask directly and hopefully I will be able to help. I have lived as mentioned above, in Italy, Spain and Indonesia and so have a combined experience of six years of living abroad.Although the Brexit result means a massive change in the way we view our UK citizenship, it does not mean that all doors are closed. There are many things you can do to positively respond to the situation and worrying is definitely not one of them.Taking immediate and direct action is the only way for you to feel better. With the possibility of Brexit, steps for young people to remain in the EU are needed and you can do this! You simply need to get out and start getting proactive about it and keep smiling , after all, things will work out!",NA,NA,4qni93,0.000209035,-0.999581931,Against,30-06-16

Boris Johnson was stabbed in the back by good friend and leave campaign buddy Michael GoveBoris Johnson and Michael Gove formed a close relationship and actively campaigned together to help the Remain side win a 52% majority in the results of the EU referendum, which has since led to the 'Brexit'.Michael Gove also helped at the beginning to get Boris Johnson support from other people in the Conservative Party. He organised talks for Boris and helped edit an article that Boris wrote on the day of the results in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.Unfortunately for Boris Johnson, Michael Gove changed his mind about backing Boris Johnson to be Prime Minister.  There are rumours that say Michael Gove deliberately weakened Boris's campaigning within the Conservative Party.They claim that once he realised there was little support for Boris Johnson to run for Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,  he decided to announce he was running instead. This came after an email his wife had written was leaked on the Internet,  showing that he had plans to run for PM and go up against Boris Johnson.See: http://pic.twitter.com/4PPv1ud4IMâ€” Darren McCaffrey (@DMcCaffreySKY) June 29, 2016#2. Boris was widely expected to run for Prime Minister  before #BorexitAfter the results,  David Cameron,  the prime minister announced his resignation as he had tried and failed to convince the UK to vote  to remain as part of the European Union.As Boris Johnson was mayor of London for eight years, many expected him to fill David Cameron's shoes after this resignation.With his wide media coverage and eccentric personality,  he is arguably the most well-known politician  after David Cameron.There were also many rumours that Boris was planning to make a coup against David Cameron if he stayed on after the EU referendum regardless of the result.  However, he never had this opportunity has Cameron resigned the morning the results came out leaving no chance for any such attack.#3. One of his fellow Conservative Party members has hammered him in the press since his announcement not to runLord Heseltine, a long time member of Parliament,  came out and attacked Boris Johnson for running away from a mess that he had help to create.Heseltine likened Boris Johnson to a military leader who cowardly runs away from his troops in battle.Heseltine said Boris Johnson seemed like â€œa general who marches his army to the sound of the guns and the moment he sees the battleground he abandons it â€¦ The pain of it will be felt by all of us and, if it doesnâ€™t get resolved shortly, by a generation to come yet.â€Shortly before Boris Johnson announced he would not run for Prime Minister,  another of his colleagues, Theresa May, made a joke about his dealings with the European Union.  She said that ""Boris negotiated in Europe...I seem to remember last time he did a deal with the Germans, he came back with three nearly-new water cannon.""#4. Ewan McGregor had some choice words for Boris Johnsonâ€™s decisionThe Scottish actor Ewan McGregor posted a scathing  assessment of Boris Johnson's decision on Twitter not long after it became public.Among other words,  he called Boris Johnson a â€œspineless c*$tâ€  for helping to create the chaos surrounding the Brexit and then deciding to run away from it.@BorisJohnson You spineless c$&t You lead this ludicrous campaign to leave EU. Win, and now fuc& off to let someone else clear up your mess.â€” Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) June 30, 2016With Ewan McGregor being Scottish, he is also likely to be angered by the fact that Scotland voted to remain part of the EU but England and Wales voting to leave will likely drag them out of the Union.#5. Boris never had a plan to deal with BrexitAlthough the remain campaign was expected to win from opinion polls and predictions the day before the referendum, the result came as a shock to many around the world.Has the most prominent figure alongside Nigel Farage in the leave campaign, many people noticed that Boris Johnson did not look particularly happy when he made his press conference on the day of the results.At first, most people thought this was because David Cameron have resigned immediately and Boris Johnson and David Cameron are long-term friends.However, it soon became clear that Boris did not have a very clear plan for the Leave vote to win, but also that he did not want to be the person to take the UK out of the European Union.Many criticised Boris Johnsonâ€™s Daily Teleghraph article shortly after the results for its lack of a clear  plan to negotiate the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.#6. #Borexit leaves the door open to #Remain campaigner, Theresa May, to become Prime MinisterNow that Boris Johnson is no longer candidate,  Theresa May has become one of the top Conservative Party politicians in the leadership race.Because Theresa May campaigned actively for the Remain vote in support of David Cameron,  it will be quite funny to watch her try to negotiate the Brexit deal with the European Union.Obviously, she still has to win the Conservative Party election before that is an issue, but as Michael Gove has said he would  not be a very good Prime Minister,  it seems that Theresa May might quickly become the favourite in the Conservative Party leadership contest.Whether voting for remain means that Theresa May will try to get the most flexible deal for the United Kingdom after Brexit is still unclear.#7. Boris Johnson has only ever won elections as a protest candidateBoris Johnson was elected as Mayor of London on two different occasions. However, both time the majority of his support came for those who wanted to protest against the previous London mayor Ken Livingstone.Many Londoners felt unhappy with Ken Livingstone role as Mayor of London  and ignored political allegiances to vote for Boris Johnson.Similarly, the popular support for the Leave vote was viewed as a protest vote against both David Cameron and politicians and political parties in general.Perhaps Boris realised that as he was no longer the protest option, he might not have such good chances to win the Conservative Party leadership election.#8. Boris Johnson's father supported the remain campaignBoris Johnson's father, Stanley Johnson,  has spoken openly about  Michael Gove betraying his son.In the same interview, he also surprisingly said that he voted for Remain in the European referendum election.This was very surprising as  his son was the most public figure for the Leave campaign.  In a referendum that has divided families and the country, to hear of such a division in Boris Johnson family is quite shocking for many.It also adds to the bizarre events that have been happening after the shock Brexit result and the win for the leave campaign. What will happen in the coming weeks is anybody's guess but one thing is for certain: Boris Johnson will not be the next prime minister of this country after his incredible #Borexit",NA,NA,4qo6zj,4.79E-25,-1,Against,30-06-16

So there is bigger risks, especially for smaller nations, to leave. Hence you are forced economically. Not forced with military means. I would hazard a guess that not a single nation thought they would need to rely on the EU as much as they do. And that is the point, it was supposed to be a free trade union not a fucking political union, which they backdoored on many countries which rejected it.

7723,2,pingieking,"No.  You are just straight up wrong in this case.  The two years are their as a buffer for both parties to get ready for the UK leaving.  The renegotiation is an option that they can choose to engage in, but that is entirely separate from article 50.  But even given all that, it's not even important!  Leaving the EU and negotiating the new treaty is effectively two parts of one event.  They are named different things, but they are just two acts of the same play.  This is what I meant when I said ""the part you don't get""Interesting take.  Just one problem; leaving NAFTA is actually fairly simple (using your definition of simple, I would actually consider them complicated).  No part of this is undemocratic because it is entirely possible for, say Canada, to wake up tomorrow and vote to leave the NAFTA.  The difference we are having is that you think that Canada should be able to call up the US and Mexico and inform them that imports to Canada will be taxed starting in 5 days.  I say this is unreasonable and amounts to a direct economic attack on US and Mexico.  A fair person would give advanced notice and enough time for the other countries to make adjustments of their own (which is why there are out clauses).I've also said this before, and I think I'll just have to leave it there.  Your view of people and international relations is naive to the point of childishness.  If you think that the people of other countries aren't going to take advantage of you when they have the chance, then I pray that you never get elected into office.Go look at history.  While this does not occur on a regular basis it is in not a rare event.You said that the window should be a months rather than 2 years.  I think 2 years is quite fitting for the treaty.It doesn't actually matter if both sides gets hurt.  Country A has no right to simply dictate a change in rules to country B the way you are suggesting.  To use your words, it's undemocratic for the people of country A to decide on something that will negatively effect the people of country B without their input.Then you guys should vote them out and then step out of the CETA agreement.  We in Canada like the CETA agreement, and I hope that there are some out clauses built into the CETA treaties that compensates us for our losses when you guys change the rules on us.  Basically, if Europeans want to screw over our Canadian investments, I think we should be compensated for that.There are out clauses, and the out clauses are designed to prevent chaos from developing in Johannesburg.  The problem is that what you consider democratically acceptable is probably not acceptable to anyone in South Africa.It is just as undemocratic for one party (Europe in the CETA example) to change the rules without consulting the other party (Canada).  I don't bitch and moan about it because I recognize that it is a reality of life.  All I ask is that there is fair compensation for the troubles that your party (Europe) has caused us (Canada).At the end of all this discussion, I think I have boil my arguments down to just one central theme:  Your arguments come off as very naive and have no basis in the real world.  It all sounds great on paper, but your entire argument rests on the idea that everyone in the world will do their best to look after everyone else in the world and not try to take advantage of them.  I say that people will take advantage of others, if given the chance (just look at history for all the times this has occurred).  This is why international treaties work like other civil legal documents; clauses are put in place to deter one party from taking advantage of the other.  If your argument is that a country needs to retain its democratic right to screw over other countries, then I'll concede that.  All I have to say about that is ""good luck with that"".",d4uucb2,d4ufg80,4q0ei6,0.999999039,0.999998079,Brexit,01-07-16

7728,2,cluo40,"I read it over. First thing I should mention is that this isn't a neutral paper in the slightest as it was commissioned by Partij voor de Vrijheid or Party for Freedom, a right wing populist party in the Netherlands. Even though they might say in their disclaimer that they were neutral, realistically, this paper was heavily influenced as the research you conduct has to be of value to the PVV. The main thing I would like to focus on in this report is their last few pages which shows their models and assumptions. One thing I'd like to point out is two things. 1) You yourself have said you don't like long term predictions. However, just about everything in this paper is predicting through 2025 or 2035. Needless to say, such a far out prediction is used more as indicators than exact figures. This is also why I don't tend to talk about long term predictions in my posts about Brexit. I simply state what the banks are more certain about and it's more an educated guess than a wild swing in the dark. 2) Their assumptions are a bit stretched. They say post Nexit, within 6 months ~ 1 yr, GDP growth stabilize will be at 1% (doesn't even go negative) and after that, GDP growth will be at 2% for roughly 10 years before reaching their terminal growth rate.Well, using those assumptions, literally any EU country would look good. From 1988 to 2016, Netherlands hasn't hit 2% GDP growth once. They peaked in the 1990s at like 1.7% i think so even if you assume that Nexit will help your GDP, you have to slowly ramp up from their 2015 GDP growth of roughly 0.1 or 0.2%. Overall, I believe that these guys are experts at what they do. I am not a macroeconomist so they clearly understand more than I do in that regard. They present valid economic data but it's in the assumptions they make that I think there's a few flaws. This also happens to be my strong suit as I do financial modeling for work.  This is also pretty normal considering they were commissioned to do this by a group that obviously wants these results. Lastly, I'm so disappointed in their sensitivity tests. It's like college freshman model level of sensitivity testing. They run it against 1 changed factor and use those 2 numbers as their range of 1.1~1.5b. Usually you run multiple factors that can change for at least 9 possible scenarios with your highs and lows as your range. ",d4uut03,d4uggi8,4qlg3f,9.39E-11,-1,Against,01-07-16

Basically what you just said is that ever european citizen who is not british is an immigrant when he comes fo the uk to work and thats wrong. The aim of the eu is to enable all citizens to travel and work freely in all eu contries. Immigrants instead come from Iraq Syria or basically from every non eu country. For those people every state can define a specific set of rules which enables those people to get integrated into the society or get rejected and sent back to its originating country. And off course those rules need to be in line with the human rights set by the eu. P. S i am no expert. This explanation is my understanding of this matter. I just tried to explain to you that eu citizens coming to GB are not the same as immigrants. Tell me if i am wrong this debate interests me very much. ,d4v0kct,d4uikzq,4qixql,0.998406802,0.996813604,Brexit,01-07-16

7767,2,nameisforshow,"Again, why would you want to invest any kind of capital into the UK when you're not sure what their trade agreements will be with other nations. Sure, Europe isn't the only country on Earth.One reason why people would want to set up capital in the UK is for the benefit of: 1) being in the UK 2) having access to the rest of the EU. Whatever one country gets, ***the rest offer*** in terms of trade agreements. So if you have set up a trade agreement with Germany, you can trade with every single one of the other countries in the EU as they all have the same trade rules, regulations and laws. That's the benefit of the trade bloc. If you make a TV in the UK, it already has all the regulations and laws to go to the rest of the EU. Now that they UK is ***out*** of the EU, it is now completely uncertain what those rules and regulations will be in regards to the rest of the EU. Therefore ***new*** capital is afraid of investing in the UK and who can blame them. It's really quite simple. Why invest in the UK when you can just go to Germany and get a better deal, especially if you were to build a factory. Except for the crashing pound for starters. The longer they take on separating from the EU, the worse it's going to be. Absolutely no trade negotiations with the EU will happen until Article 50 is invoked and the UK has made good on their move from the EU. Only then will negotiations for trade even start. Which means no one is going to want to invest capital into the UK until then. Major companies have already said that.The regulations the UK tried to get out of will likely ***still*** be imposed. They will ***not*** get complete control of their boarders because of the terms the EU puts on being able to tap into their trade bloc. The UK will ***still*** have to pay the EU a fee for being part of trade bloc too. You know what the best part about all of this is?Now they do not have a say ***at all*** in what the EU does. Not to mention all the major players that wanted to leave the EU are now fucking backing out and running away. Boris Johnson, the poster child for the Brexit campaign? He's fucking gone lol. He's not taking control and he was so excited the day before the vote! Enough to suggest it's the UK's independence day lololololololol.I really hope that the UK comes out clean on this, but this shit is going to get messy. And for what gain?

Like I said before, many people (including those voting for Brexit) expected an initial hit. The question has always been what the results would be on the long run.If I read what you say I guess the outcome is that we will have to wait and see what the outcome for the EU will be. That should eventually give the best indication.

Let me mainly focus on TTIP as I know more about it, but as far as I know, most the things that apply to TTIP also apply to CETA.One of the huge problems with TTIP is that it gives business the ability to sue a country if it would not want to apply to some rules in the treaty. Letâ€™s say for example that a country want to pan a specific type of poison being used on fruit and so we want to block fruit coming into our country if the poison was used on it. Then if the treaty does not say anything about it, the company can sue the country.Again completely going into to the democratic process of a countryAnd it get even worst. The suing will not be handled in a court, but by 3 representative. One representing the company, one the country and one that should be more objective. So you even cut out your own court system.And this is a scenario where a law changes after the treaty, but in reality there are probably already many national laws that might conflict with the treaty. That is what you get when you make a treaty for many different countries at one (The EU).Also the about â€˜voting them outâ€™. While we have some information, most of it is secret. MEPâ€™s are allowed to see the documents but have to go into a room without any materials that they could use to â€˜copyâ€™ anything. Also the negotiation are not openly done by all nations but by a select few people. That is how they role in the EU.And like I said, they want to speed up the process to prevent us from voting everybody out.. and even if we would be able to vote them out, then they simply wait for a signature until we at some point have a parliament that is willing to sign the paper.Heck, they are even talking about trying to cut out the national parliament. They know that if it will go to the national parliaments there will be referendums (in some countries they can be requested, while in most cases itâ€™s not a binding referendum). Now the EU has the power to make trade agreements without the national parliaments signature (This was part of the Lisbon Treaty, that the Dutch also voted against btw!). Now TTIP will have to many things that are going outside those boundaries requiring the national parliaments to give their signature. But they are looking to get out of this.This sort of things are not helping with the popularity of the EU.

7999,2,cluo40,"Like most articles about economics that are trying to point a reader in a certain direction, it has some truths and a lot of stretched truths. I'll use the first myth as an example: While that might be true, what leverage does the UK have in negotiating a better trade deal? The UK has no special industry outside of finance (will touch on that later) in which is holds an irreplaceable value to the EU that would help provide negotiating leverage. Just because you currently import more than you export(duh UK is an service economy) doesn't actually give u any leverage. In my opinion, it's equally as likely that the EU will set harsh trade agreement with the UK to set a disincentive for other countries who want to leave.Also while we're on jobs: Financial services employment in Great Britain 1,041,800. Banks are expected to pull out roughly 20% of their investment bankers from London into different European countries. Although not all 1m employees are ibankers, u can probably expect around 10-25k jobs gone still in this one department alone. Other parts of the UK's financial and insurance sectors are also hurting too. I don't have time to cover everything right now but in economics and finance, everything can be written one way or another. It's not exact science. Someone with an agenda will clearly be able to write their outcome before they even write their reasoning behind it so take everything with a grain of salt. I tried to be as neutral as possible in writing this but I'm personally against Brexit (along with just about every college in the finance industry) so it's possible this came out biased too.

With the EU disrupted part of that trade will move towards countries that are still members of the EU. Not all of it, is kinda hard to tell how much, but that the EU tends to favor doing business between their own members is a known fact.Nobody believes that there will be no trade agreement with the UK, the point in discussion is how much will it take for that trade agreement to take place (it required 7 years for canada) and how much favorable will that be to Britain.Actually the problem with those 3 million jobs was not about trade agreement but rather about the position of britain in the European system. Companies that seek to have a legal European HQ will have to move out as the UK no longer qualifies as that.True, because they did not need it, they were in the EU, now that the UK is no longer there they currently won't have an agreement and that will take time, time in which the UK will be penalized by this lack of agreements.That is a big ""who knows?"". Nothing says that Britain will be able to, even if other countries currently do and uncertainty has never been good for an economy.Maybe they will be ok but is quite a huge gamble the UK is taking.Yeah .. that is a myth, they are not.this is not true, as in you don't have to pay billions to implement all the eu regulations, you can do what you want, but hell is right about not having a say on what the eu doesif you seriously think you will have more influence on the EU from outside than from the inside, then Britain has some serious delusions.the EU will do what they want without having britain count for even the fraction of the decision power it used to have.All these things paint an incredibly unrealistic painting of the UK able to do what it wants with the rest of the world having to follow suit or die but britain is not nearly as powerful.The world 5th largest economy is a data flaunted as if is significant enough to make a huge difference but if the first 3 economy don't do that, and the 4th is inside the EU, how can you possibly think that as the 5th one you will be the deciding factor in what happens in Europe.The truth is that the UK will either find a way to work with the EU at EU conditions or the EU will continue to work with the 3 biggest economies as it always done and treat the 5th biggest economy like an afterthought, admitting that UK will be able to remain the 5th biggest economy and will not be surpassed by India, brasil or other members of the EUOk that is a myth and is stupid, WWII and the intention to not relive any of that brought all the peace that can be seen today to europe. It has nothing to do with the EU.We should probably ask Cornwall about this.When you have to invoke one single survey that is 6 years old you know you don't have a good point to make.There is no free trade agreement right now, also this fails to consider that the agreements with Switzerland and Norway include all the things you voted to go out for. There is no free trade agreement without the freedom of movement allowed attached to it.Seems like all the complaints are about Boo hoo why does Europe believe that is bigger more powerful and more important than Britain?Answer: Because it is.Which will not happen because along with those trade agreements there are agreements about free circulation of people, you don't want that anymore, and we don't want to trade on those terms to countries that do not accept those terms.

8072,2,goingdiving,"Once Britain withdraws they have two years to complete the exit and after that they can start drafting a trade agreement. During the drafting time, UK will be traded with according to WTO rules. Two errors with this, first they are only looking to goods whereas it is services that is actually the most important piece here. UK would most likely lose the EU banking passport and with that a large chunk of financial services will disappear. The planned EU financial department will also be placed outside UK and with that disappears a lot of UK clout. Second, EU prefers internal trade, goods that are made in UK now could move outside, or other EU countries could see a chance to capture market. I'd say a good 50% of UK current market shares in goods are at risk.The Lisbon treaty states nothing of the sort, this is an outright lieAgain, this is disregarding EU internal trading that UK currently  controls, mostly the financial sector with outside EU money flowing through UK to all other EU nations with the help of the banking passport that is at risk. 3 million jobs is probably a quite conservative estimate, especially if the clearing houses disappear from London.Yes, problem is that upon exit UK are excluded from these agreements, so they would have to sit down with 50 countries to renegotiate FTA, this takes time, 5-10 years per agreement.EU common market exists to enable intra market trade primarily, external trade is secondary but EU uses it's economic might and market size to negotiate preferential FTA with other countries. UK would not at all have the same negotiating power at the tables.Sure, and look at their anemic growth since the 90's, does UK want to emulate the Japan economic dysfunction? Here are some economic highlights of Japan lately*Japanese Economy Dodges Recession in Q1* *Japan GDP Shrinks Less than Expected**Japanese Economy Contracts 0.4% in Q4* *Japanese Economy Avoids Recession in Q3* Looks swell, my personal favorite is the second one.That is true, but unless UK is planning to become a China or India staying outside of EU will do nothing to achieve that growth. The decline in global GDP is more due to the rapid rise of China than it is to any type of rapid contraction in EU. It's not an outright lie, more like a lie by omission.But you are still paying, you still have to enact EU laws and you still have to accept the four freedoms, this is a stupid argument.Yes, thanks to EU negotiated FTA that will all be null and void once Brexit is declared, so how is this something positive?Mainly because UK today is EU banking capital, once leaving the EU this secure money flow is not so secure anymore.There are many wishful thinking scenarios and outright lies in this website, I really can't be bothered looking through it all...Perhaps someone else will continue?",d4vxjo3,4qt2ms,4qt2ms,9.76E-06,-0.999980476,Against,02-07-16
8073,2,say-it-louder,"How would the UK ""impose"" this agreement? An agreement has to be negotiated and agreed to by *both* parties. The EU has  signaled so far that they are in favor of a Free Trade Agreement with the UK (just like they already have with Norway or Switzerland) if the UK is willing to preserve the four liberties, including freedom of movement.That would certainly be a consideration. However, this is not taking into account the fact that the EU is a trading bloc, and the UK will be an isolated country. [Half the exports](https://www.uktradeinfo.com/Statistics/OverseasTradeStatistics/Pages/EU_and_Non-EU_Data.aspx) from the UK are to the EU. Only 7% of the exports from [Germany](http://www.worldstopexports.com/germanys-top-import-partners/) or [France](http://www.worldstopexports.com/frances-top-import-partners/2167/) are to the UK.The UK has more to lose from a bad trade deal than the EU.That's correct. Yeah! However, there are tariffs associated with these rules that will make British goods and services more expensive in the EU, and therefore less competitive. Furthermore, these trading rules would not include the [passporting regulations](https://next.ft.com/content/e8b14d60-3a36-11e6-9a05-82a9b15a8ee7) that the UK financial institutions benefit from today.Yes, that's correct, but that obviously does not include the UK. Many of these agreements require adoption of the four liberties. Will the UK want such an agreement?Yes, the tariffs are low on average, but that's not how tariffs work. Tariffs are used in specific categories of good or services in order to protect a national interest. This is something that could [hurt the UK economy](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36628918). Furthermore this claim that tariffs are inconsequential is inconsistent with the claim that the UK would benefit from a good trade deal. Either trade deals matter or they don't.It's not, but both only have access to the EU market because they offer free movement of people.That is conveniently forgetting that the EU is a trading block. It's true that for the UK the trading with individual countries in the EU is less than the trading with the US, but the trading between the UK and the EU *dwarfs* the trading with any other country (about 50% of the trade). So, the best trading relationship *by far* for the UK is with the EU.Again, you can't treat the EU as individual countries when it's convenient.

8091,2,TwoShipApocalypse,"QUOTE:Ok the first one has several false premisesThis seems to Imply that britain has the power to impose anything to the EU which is obviously false.The point here is that The EU tries to trade internally as much as they can. With the EU disrupted part of that trade will move towards countries that are still members of the EU. Not all of it, is kinda hard to tell how much, but that the EU tends to favor doing business between their own members is a known fact.Nobody believes that there will be no trade agreement with the UK, the point in discussion is how much will it take for that trade agreement to take place (it required 7 years for canada) and how much favorable will that be to Britain.Actually the problem with those 3 million jobs was not about trade agreement but rather about the position of britain in the European system. Companies that seek to have a legal European HQ will have to move out as the UK no longer qualifies as that.True, because they did not need it, they were in the EU, now that the UK is no longer there they currently won't have an agreement and that will take time, time in which the UK will be penalized by this lack of agreements.That is a big ""who knows?"". Nothing says that Britain will be able to, even if other countries currently do and uncertainty has never been good for an economy.Maybe they will be ok but is quite a huge gamble the UK is taking.Yeah .. that is a myth, they are not.this is not true, as in you don't have to pay billions to implement all the eu regulations, you can do what you want, but hell is right about not having a say on what the eu doesif you seriously think you will have more influence on the EU from outside than from the inside, then Britain has some serious delusions.the EU will do what they want without having britain count for even the fraction of the decision power it used to have.All these things paint an incredibly unrealistic painting of the UK able to do what it wants with the rest of the world having to follow suit or die but britain is not nearly as powerful.The world 5th largest economy is a data flaunted as if is significant enough to make a huge difference but if the first 3 economy don't do that, and the 4th is inside the EU, how can you possibly think that as the 5th one you will be the deciding factor in what happens in Europe.The truth is that the UK will either find a way to work with the EU at EU conditions or the EU will continue to work with the 3 biggest economies as it always done and treat the 5th biggest economy like an afterthought, admitting that UK will be able to remain the 5th biggest economy and will not be surpassed by India, brasil or other members of the EUOk that is a myth and is stupid, WWII and the intention to not relive any of that brought all the peace that can be seen today to europe. It has nothing to do with the EU.We should probably ask Cornwall about this.When you have to invoke one single survey that is 6 years old you know you don't have a good point to make.There is no free trade agreement right now, also this fails to consider that the agreements with Switzerland and Norway include all the things you voted to go out for. There is no free trade agreement without the freedom of movement allowed attached to it.Seems like all the complaints are about Boo hoo why does Europe believe that is bigger more powerful and more important than Britain?Answer: Because it is.Which will not happen because along with those trade agreements there are agreements about free circulation of people, you don't want that anymore, and we don't want to trade on those terms to countries that do not accept those terms.

There isn't any. Well, there is, to a fool who hasn't done any research. Cos you'll notice, the vast majority against the EU as a political system have done their research.The level of political belligerence from the EU means that I don't care about what special deals the UK had with the EU. I care about Europe, and subsequently the globe, when megalomaniacal power hungry fucks, [who without the Eurosceptics in the European parliament would have done god only knows what up until now], seem to want to fade borders and merge nation-states into one gigantic cluster fuck with a continental army and police force. For me, this was never about JUST the UK. This is about the liberation of Europe and by doing our bit, we can achieve this. Think logically, in the beginning almost nobody born into the EU was against it, but now, after time, people began to research themselves and suddenly we have growing numbers all over Europe, it's not a fucking coincidence that this is happening. It's a culmination of the EU's failure to truthfully acknowledge nation states by having totally free movement and their total lack of understanding of the differentiating European economic markets. I mean one interest rate for the whole of Europe? FUCKING REALLY? Even a high-school student could figure out it doesn't work.I implore you, do the research, if nothing else you'll find peace of mind with leaving the EU.It's a big elephant in the European room so to speak. Think about it? Anyone that dared question the EU, [to an extent it's the same even now], was laughed at, called a crackpot, idiot and nobody took their concerns seriously. Which is actually, exactly what happened every time ANY power-hungry, centralizing force came to power.People thought that anyone against Hitler in his rise to power was ""an idiot"". ""un-ethical"" and all the rest of it. Exactly the same with Stalin. The media is CLEARLY biased towards the EU/remain, and you know that it is 100% fact by the evidence that NOBODY in the world, eve,r says it's biased TOWARDS leaving the EU. You know, the leave contingent feel and see strong suggestions that almost ALL media outlets are biased towards the EU whereas  the remain contingent probably deem the media to be totally fair, in fact, most of the naive youth do. I did too. I used to think the BBC was unbiased. But it isn't... it's one of the worst.I implore you. Research. Look around.

8132,2,doodledraft,"Granting the previous commenters their valid points, I think, in a situation like brexit where confidence, uncertainty, and volatility are such huge factors, it definitely counteracts this notion that the UK is alone and small. There was specious rhetoric to the effect of moving to the end of the line; there was derogatory language about ""little Englanders""; and to that, despite the issues of attempting negotiations before the separation, etc, the following portion of the text is relevant:   And this is in contrast to the wailing and the hopelessness of those lamenting the vote. That said, if you look at the two main active parts of the bill, Section 3 and 4, they both don't have consequence as I understand it.  Section 4 that suggests a fairly rapid timetable of negotiations regardless of membership status is the least realistic even if this were valid. It's significance is rhetorical, essentially saying in spirit, where it necessary, the US would be there for the UK in a heartbeat.  Section 3 however, is the crux. In keeping with the title of the bill, the ""United Kingdom Trade Continuity Act"" Section 3(a) is somewhat meaningless at the moment in regards to the big issue everyone is talking about: Free trade agreements. The text reads   Well that's a bit of a weird concept... The United States and the EU do not currently have a specific free trade agreement. There is currently an agreement in negotiation called TTIP (or TAFTA) but it is not finished/signed. The only trade agreement that the US and EU are a party to that ""governs commerce between the United States and the United Kingdom"" is the World Trade Organization, but they are double represented... that means that the UK is, like other EU countries, part of the WTO both as an EU member nation, and as itself. So even if the UK were outside of the EU, it would still be trading with the US as itself a WTO member.  The only way this bill would apply the way you'd think from reading it, is if 1) the UK is still a member of the EU when TTIP is signed, and 2) that TTIP isn't written to preclude this act (""unless such an agreement specifically provides otherwise""). If it was still a member if/when TTIP is signed, and there is no clause precluding this, and then the UK finalized it's Article 50, then it would have the effect of allowing trade with the UK under TTIP until a new deal could be negotiated. So like I said, the main significance of this bill is in it's statement of support for the UK in light of all the crazytalk out there. The Bill cites $114 Billion trade volume with the US for 2015; the CIA factbook shows that was out of $1,059 Billion global trade volume for 2015. The bill says a country that made $3,945 Billion in global trade last year, and with whom the UK shared 10.7% of this trade volume, is here and ready to continue doing business.",d4werad,4qvuvm,4qvuvm,8.80E-05,-0.999824088,Against,02-07-16

However, this is a fraction of the gross annual cost that Britain must pay for EU membership which is now Â£18.4bn, or Â£51mn a day.""1.) The UK does not pay Â£18.4bn for EU membership, this intentionally wrong number ignores the UK rebate.2.) The UK actually gets most of that money back, the net payment of the UK to the EU is ""only"" approximately Â£4bn/year. Note: due to the way the EU pays out grants, the UK's net payment can vary a lot from year to year.Don't let anybody mislead you by cherrypicking a number from one specific year.3.) Norway is a much smaller country than the UK. Comparing Norway totals to UK totals is crap. You'd need to compare per capita numbers.4.) The Norway number actually is obsolete and incomplete. Norway pays 388 million Euro per year through the current EEA and Norway Grants scheme, and 478 million euro into a couple of EU programs where Norway participates.

8166,2,Nobody_Anybody,"""Never made that claim"" When I say it's now at the point of March 2014, You say the point dropping because of Brexit, it is self-inflicted .That seem to suggest that the fact that it is self-inflicted is more important then the fact that the pound dropped. If not, then I have no idea why you even mentioned it.â€œYes it does because it was wholly avoidable. â€And by saying this you in fact again basically say that it being self-inflicted is more important then the drop. Because not it is somehow worse.Fact is that the point where the pound is not is not a huge deal. It is where is was in March of 2014. The pound had slowly been dropping since mid 2014 so might have ended up where it is now anyway by the end of the year. And in fact it might even have a positive effect as it means products and vacations in your country are a little cheaper as what they where just for the Brexit.Of course it also has it negative sides, all I am saying it is not the end of the world. And the fact that something is avoidable does not mean you should not make that decision.It's like when you buy an item from your store. After you did by it your bank-account has less money on it. Obviously more money on your bank-account is better. But that does not yet mean you should not every by something.Most people knew that at least on the short run the UK would take a hit on the economy. Most of the debate is about the long-term effect. But a majority of the voters clearly agrees taking that hit in exchange for more freedom and more democracy.â€œIf the trend continues to stay at the 1.3 to the dollar mark as it is now, that means that the UK people arguably lost a % of their potential earnings, all based on a dishonest campaign if you care to learn moreÂ about it.â€ Well inflation sucks.

Now the UK is not in the Euro (because you did not listen to the experts) so you do not have this problem.

The difference between capitalism and corporatism seems to be very hard to understand for some people, including the writer of the article.The first part of the part I quoted here is correct, the last sentence however is false. Sadly for him, his complete article is based upon that idea. The EU is a primary vehicle for a corporatism project, not a capitalistic project.Capitalism (the most used form) is all build upon the idea that a market where people are trying to make money, result in an fair and working system. While having some minor measurements in place to prevent things like monopoly positions. So it basically comes down to private property, making money and a free marked where supply and demand drive the prices of products.Corporatism is a system where the big business (and other groups) are supposed to make the laws. That will usually result in something completely different as what capitalism results in as capitalism is based on the idea that if a product is two expensive another company will make the product for a better price. But with corporatism companies will try to prevent this from happening. Also think about things like lower income, inflation and so on.The EU is like the article says very undemocratic, and this it true. It is mainly run by the lobby, and who are behind that lobby? Big businesses. So most laws in the EU come from businesses meaning the EU is more like a corporatism then a capitalistic system.You could say that a capitalistic system is not run by businesses, but it is build upon the market (what mainly are businesses of all sizes). A corporatism system is run by big businesses.Many right-winged and pro capitalism persons are against corporatism, as well as many left-winged people, while they do confuse it for capitalism a lot, if not most of the time.The right-winged people are just liberals. They want a small governmental, and few rules, let the market do their things, just make sure things do not go out of hand and the the governmental only do a few main task it has to do.

The ECHR can be found here :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_RightsAlmost all of the rights can be restricted ""in accordance with law"" so effectively the EU can breach any human rights if it so wishes. Rights against torture can't be breached but that's easy to circumvent since torture isn't well defined. Since British law can't override the ECHR, this turns the entire document into a tool to move control to the EU - it can be applied when the EU disagrees with an individual state, and ignored when the EU wishes.The UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights has the same problem:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_RightsSee Article 29 Section 3: These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.The US Constitution contains no such restrictions which means it becomes a wholly different beast.

At ten-a-Torie Downing Street, conversing with his crew,  to plan a plan to stem the flow of Nigel's UKIP coup,  of once devoted followers, now flocking from his team,  to zealot fiend named Farrage with, a flair for the extreme.   So Cameron with hands now tied, and fearing for his job,   played his final trump card to, consolidate his mob,  made a vow he thought low risk, to pay for their devotion,  true to Rumpelstiltskin, he, would pass a heinous motion,  and gambled with his countries youth, to keep his club to heel,  A reckless, feckless roll of die, a flippant spin of wheel.  A vote to keep or leave our post, in Europe hit the nation,  Hot debates were rife amidst untold misinformation.  Both the parties were at fault, for muddying the water.   Slinging muck at opposition, further than they oughta.  Brexiters were most concerned, with heightened immigration,  Sovereignty (or lack thereof) a source of their frustration.   Democracy was said to be, the thing that mattered most.  But MPs here are voted in by 'soonest past the post'.  In searching for a system with a flaw, here I dogmatic;  House of Commons it is not a system democratic.   Nor in fact our monarchy, our Lizzie most angelic,  throne a right of birth by chance- an antiquated relic.  Central to the Brexit cause, the most offensive bit,  the claim that foreign people here, have come to take your shit.   That refugees are hoarding all our houses up their sleeves,  a rabble of uneducated, asset stripping thieves.  A myth that grew first legs, then wings, with help from rugged- plump,  blonde, a bombshell, Johnson- Boris (London's Donald Trump).   This a fiend who has been fired, by (faking a citation),  broadsheet â€˜Timesâ€™, for falsehoods and, for lying to the nation.   And lie again for his campaign, again he would digress,  With three-and-fifty million vows, to ailing NHS.   But he alone was not to blame for lies relayed to us,  His buddy Nigel Farrage and his stupid fucking bus,  decided it appropriate, with Hitler as his muse,  To advertise the refugees aligning in their queues.  Hateful and abhorrent at, the crowd he sought to pander,  With only what can be described as Nazi propaganda.  In public eye we chose to flex, our xenophobic muscles,  and raised a middle digit to, our neighbours based in Brussels.  The vote was split discernibly, by education, wages,   a demographic schism had, emerged between the ages.   As youth remained a fickle bunch, a bitter taste to palete,  was that as few as 35 percent would come to ballot.  The Murdochs of this world would have, their say and his consumers,   turned up in their droves not least, of all the baby boomers.  readers of his scandal sheet, would have it on the day,  the price we paid for apathy, and giving up our say.  In Liverpool an island 'midst, a sea of Northen 'Leavers',  the paper 'Sun' is never read- remained EU believers.  In scorning all the warnings on the wall awash with written,   words about the impact of our choice on Greater Britain,  We left a wake of mayhem for the other EU states,  steaming heaps of faeces left upon their dinner plates.  Marine Le Pen in France has surged, with her far right agenda,  up the polls and Scotland now face further referenda.  Ita-Leave, and Swexit loom, the Euro hit the floor,  as Peace in Northen Ireland once again is all but sure.  To top it off it looks as though we will be told to beat it,  When as we ask of Brussels can, we have our cake and eat it.   Immigration clout and entry, (now it is conclusive)  to the common market are collectively exclusive.   So all we've done in leaving is, we've given up our vote,   as Europe will retain the say, in who gets off the boat.  And in what numbers migrants enter, hither from their frigates,   but worst of all we gave a voice, to xenophobic bigots.  Encouraged by the numbers who, substantiate their stance,  they saw an opportunity and wouldn't miss their chance.   Solace though, it can be found, before we go insane,  Britains youth were by and large invested in Bremain.  Hope a thing that can be found, in regions concentrated,   by our countries immigrants were stay-in-Europe weighted.  The higher the diversity within a neighbourhood,  the greater sense of fellowship, the greater chance it would,  have recognised that what we're not is socially exclusive,  but a nation made of more, a culture all-inclusive.

8234,2,L_Almogaver,"To all of those who still think Brexit is a foregone conclusion: It was not a true REFERENDUM, legally binding like what went on in Scotland, but rather a POPULAR CONSULTATION such as the one held Nov 9, 2014 in Catalonia which came out with a resounding victory for independentism but has no value what so ever. Most people voted last Thursday based on how they had been manipulated by the media, not on how they had been informed of the consequences (which is part of the due process preceding any proper referendum). And of course, their vote was irrational and stupid because they felt they were basically being asked for their uninformed opinion and did nothing but vent their uninformed anger at the ""establishment"".The Parliament can turn it down, even the Queen can turn it down. So only half of the fuckup has been done. Less than half, in fact. And it is reversible.And it looks to me like Labour and Tory politicians are vying to see who's going to be left at the forefront and tell the electorate that everything I said in the first paragraph is true, and that there will be no Brexit. Johnson dropped out early on, Gove did all the engineering to kick him out but did so in full view of the entire nation (which is either astoundingly stupid or a way of telling people ""don't vote for me either, because I led a campaign based on lies and now I've just betrayed my best friend so I can betray you, too""). In comes Theresa May who used to be a part the Remain camp (which makes her as unfit as Cameron himself) followed by some Angela Leasdom who is probably unknown even to her neighbours and pulls no weight within the party.Meanwhile in Labour Jeremy Corbyn is still trying to decide whether his predicament wants to resemble that of King Lear or Titus Andronicus. And even if a strong leader came out of the woodwork (which they won't), their leadership within a Brexit campaign would be fraught by discredit: the closest ideological pigeonhole for the Brexit campaign, after all, was a profoundly anti-intellectual, minarchist form of nativist politics--a very toned-down form of lassez-faire anarcho-fascism that has nothing to do with what Labour is about. So none of them could be trusted to get the UK out of the EU.People need to understand that the governing elite in the UK only wanted to use the vote of their own lumpen as a bargain tool of sorts in their negotiation with the EU: a controlled explosion. The UK has one of the least prepared autochthonous young populations in Europe, even at university level (anyone who has ever seen a single British PhD student or white collar worker in Continental Europe, please let me know); its working class doesn't work, large amounts of the population are marred by alcoholism and obesity; it needs not only unqualified but also qualified foreigners to keep the country rolling (from across the world, but Europe is closer and they usually have better degrees); it imports infinitely more than it exports or will ever be able to export; if it left the EU it would be alone in a world currently dominated by compact economic blocs, and geographical logistics render an overuse of the Commonwealth impractical. This is no longer the England of Keynes, Churchill and Russell. A country that cannot rely on its own local population to produce competitive science, technology and general culture will only be an economic power if it ceases to be a country and becomes a commercial hub, much in the way of Singapore. And the northern hemisphere no longer needs such a construct, let alone falls without a safety net in order to find it. And at the current stage, the few interest groups commending the ""people"" for this vote are Putin, a handful of ultra-liberal economists and brokers, and the European far-right. Well not all of it because Le Pen has kept her mouth shut these last days, and Norbert Hofer secured an Austrian second vote but is now saying they'll only remember to be Eurosceptic if Turkey enters the EU (everybody hold your breaths for that).So: cosmetic changes notwithstanding, things will be the way they are now.

8244,2,FredBargoi,"Post-Brexit thoughts, a week later... I voted to remain. A week later, bizarrely, my well-diversified equity investment portfolio has gone up (in pound value). The pound has gone down, but I plan to live in the UK for the foreseeable future, so thatâ€™s unlikely to hurt me much. I also happen to have a dual UK and European citizenship, so, my freedom of movement, and that of my children will not be affected. It also seems that the way things develop, my devalued pound will be able to buy more of the even more devalued house that has recently been so expensive. On paper, Iâ€™m a winner. But if I could vote again, I would still vote to remain.Because all those people up north who voted leave, they donâ€™t have the well-diversified equity portfolio, and they donâ€™t have the dual citizenship, and they donâ€™t have the bullshitting skills they can trade for a lot of their devalued pounds the way I do. In a tragic twist of irony, they donâ€™t even have the immigrants they need to teach in their schools and man their A&E on a Friday night. And all those people who voted on the sole motive of â€œget â€˜em outâ€ will be dead in a few years and it will be their children who will be poor and hopeless, and they wonâ€™t be happy, and they might just do something stupid, they might just decide to go the way of the third reich or communist russia, or worse, because we now have much better weapons - as we have seen, it only takes a populist asshole and a simple scare campaign. So, yeah, if there was a second referendum, I would still say stay, remain, keep the fucking bureaucrats, cause they are the school teachers that are keeping us from killing each other, and also because we donâ€™t need even more bureaucrats to help us get rid of the bureaucrats, which, by the way, _are_ elected, and that includes Nigel Farage, MEP.

Countries like Macedonia, Hungary, Czech Republic all followed the laws of the Dublin convention and kept those people penned behind border gates and got their property vandalized as a result.This wasn't an official directive of the EU. It was an ad-lib invitation by Merkel to anyone who wanted ""ze gut life"" in Germany or elsewhere.The EU didn't create it, but they facilitated it. They allowed it. Cos Frau Merkel got her whip out and got what she wanted.And in regards to the video : Did he mention the continental Army that the EU want, that everyone seems to think isn't a thing?Did he rebut that one economic model doesn't fit the whole of Europe?Did he acknowledge that fishing waters are sectioned unjustly and has systematically destroyed our fishing industry?No he did not. So he is avoiding some of the important issues. For what reason? People are most certainly asking these questions about the EU.Just like in his other video, he totally slides over the fact that the EU isn't just trying their best for every nation. They have a motive and a direction they are headed in, and it's entirely feasible that at some point, countries within it, will not like it and either want to change it, or if they can't, leave. But all he's focused on is the leave campaign lies. Why doesn't he look at the remain side also?

That means that you import a lot more goods from the EU than you sell to the EU countries.

We can see that emigration trumps EU immigration from the previous edit. The document does not appear to show **where UK emigrants go**, just raw figures on how many left. Given that it may very well be that UK emigrants go to somewhere else besides the EU, it may be that the population of immigrants and emigrants in and from the UK (respectively) may be closer than I imagine; But given that the UK has the largest population of immigrants to the EU, it seems reasonable to say that my statement holds true, just not as comically large as I was implying.Edit3: Apparently a percentage of the EU immigrant figures in the document also count **British citizens** immigrating to the UK! I'm assuming this is some silliness related to how the immigration laws work, but according to the document:and also(total immigration)Which means that British citizens apparently make up ~14% of EU immigration, according to the latest figures!

Likewise, we shouldn't be involved in Syria, and we shouldn't have been in Libya. Cameron has as much blood on his hands from that.It's just my opinion, but austerity has hobbled Britain's recovery.

In the video I mention only a very short but powerful list of examples which other regions of the world simply do not enjoy; I'm even taking into consideration the damage being done in the west from idiocies such as the Snoopers Charter. Stating positive facts, each of which have strong arguments behind them, isn't the same as the mindless chanting of ""USA, USA, USA"" sentiment which I believe you're interpreting it to be. One is a rational point of view and the other can be (as you suggest) very destructive.My argument is that the separation of the church and the state is a positive step forward in the development of human civilization but I'm not using it as a reason to keep Muslims out as you suggest. Actually, the opposite is true; why would I care what religion someone is if they can't use the force of the state to make me do something I don't want to do?

8535,2,Vermino,"First off, kudos for making a piece on your own opinion.  Not a re-tweet of someone else's opinion.  Personally I can only have respect for a well formed opinion, even though it may defer from mine - as I believe that's the position in which people can change their opinion if they so desire.  &amp;nbsp;  **Economic**  Obviously noone can see in the future, and economy is fickle and very hard to predict.  Not even experts saw many of the market crashes (some may have predicted them, but the general consensus did not).  Given that economy is fickle, and nigh impossible to control.  Would you rather face burdens in a group, or alone?  Imagine if Greece wouldn't have been in the EU.  Can you imagine the devastation?  Being in a group of countries is great, because it balances out extremes (this works on other aspects as well)  So a huge depression may occur, but the countries with a huge low will be balanced out by countries that weren't hit that hard.  And by that social motto, we're all better off.  Staying in the EU gives you a certain economic stability.  Which is a huge plus.  Downside ofcourse is that you may sometimes have to pay for other country's mistakes.  On top of that, trade with partners in the EU is cheaper, and more interesting.  Even with a Brexit, there will always be trade with Europe.  And Britain will ofcourse remain a serious trading force due to it's expertise and working force.  But it'll be less effective.  &amp;nbsp;  **Immigration**  I agree that Britain is one of the most 'advanced' cultures in the world.  Do you think that occured because they 'protected' their old ways, or by embracing new challenges head on?   (it's the 2nd one)   By realising that diversity is key to advancement, and everyone brings something to the table - even if it does look like a dead skunk to begin with.  So mingling with other cultures is probably how you're going to adapt to the new global situation.  Culture is something someone can adapt to, and Culture itself can change over time.  It's how WILLING you are as an individual to take other values, other principles.  It's not something you only learn after you have generations of children.  And as long as you're a productive member of society, who cares what you celebrate at home for example?  I'll agree that it's a threat if people bunch together and not adapting to their new situation.  The examples you gave how other cultures are inferiour aren't really about their culture.  They're examples of poverty, abuse of power, indoctrination, lack of education, and so much more.  The african culture is beautiful thanks to their general spirit - although riddled with abuse in power.  The culture in the middle east had flourishing times in the middle ages, but is now overshadowed by religious zeal.  No culture is 'Better' than the other.  They're all unique.  They're not incompatible.  As you said, there's nothing wrong with moderation.  People from all over the world can adapt other values and ideals if they want.  Massive immigration is worth discussing, and is something scary.  And it should be well handled, but it's not something to be scared of, or be protected.  On top of that, we as european countries should understand the value of taking in people in need.  We've all heard the stories of hardships in the world wars.  And the many stories of families caring for others.  I'm sure you all know Anne Frank.  &amp;nbsp;  **Moral**  What I can't get my head around is how 'direct accountability' seems to be a holy grail for some people.  Your argument is that national government is a step towards your goal - a local government.  A national government is just as bad (see your point of economics to prove how inadequate they are)  As for local government - 1 person changing something in a local society seems highly undemocratic as well.  I believe it's really unrealistic to think you'll have 100-man governments all over the world.  It also sounds highly inefficient in terms of overhead.  And Why?  So you could have direct involvement into your government.  Look at the referendum, 27% of people didn't even care about that to have a direct influence into government.  Imagine if you had direct involvement in ever small matter your local government did?  Think of the massive deadlock you could get if 2 opposing factions were against each other.  Or what if one village had a large family, they could instigate slavery again.  And as you said in your own economic part, usually politicians aren't very good in expert aspects.  Let's face it, sometimes a higher, more global, government is needed.  Voting with more people balances out extremes again.  But that also means letting go of that direct control.  It's really not that bad.  The EU has been set up so all members states keep having their voice, so it's a collective thing.  Everyone has a voice, noone is left behind.  Even the small eastern countries, with low economic or military power, can have their say.  Which also makes it so hugely inefficient and slow.  But, that's a good thing.  As you said, we're all working on this together.  And again, a group balances out the extremes.  So extreme left or right are very hard to get to.  Yes, all of this comes at a price.  And yes, you might be doing a better job if you were deciding, or maybe your neighbour.  But let's face it, we all have something 'better' to do.  And in the end it's the only way to come to a glocal culture.  Look at the internet.  There's people speaking up and fighting politicians even though couldn't directly influence them.  It's given the power more people.  People often say 'Remain' is the status quo, and 'Leave' is the path to change.  But it's actually the other way around.  'Leave' is the status in which Britain has been for hundreds of years.  A national power.  'Remain' is the path of change to something larger, something more global.  Again, EU isn't a shiny object I adore.  We as a people have to be vigilant and constantly monitor their activities.  Hidden agenda's and agencies like the NSA should be fought at every turn.  And I believe we as a united people of Europe, with plenty of common sense - be it Belgian, British, Swedish, Polish, ... - will be up for the task.  And I'd welcome anyone who upholds those values, even from outside the EU.  ",d4z9qit,4r6p56,4r6p56,0.999998581,0.999997162,Brexit,04-07-16

What struck me was that even those who were closely following the coverage were only able to repeat back their arguments in a series of sound bites which lacked any substance. I think it's because many people defer to authority, especially when it comes to economics and politics that they don't delve any deeper into the arguments.When speaking to people about Brexit, I've tried to use some basic principles when examining the key topics of discussion and I've been genuinely pleased with everyone's receptiveness. They are not perfect but they do, I believe, offer an alternative point of view on the subject.I also hope that regardless whether you voted Leave or Remain, the video will give you some hope for the future.Regards, Alttldr; Brief discussion about the key Brexit topics from a slightly different point of view.

8643,2,scrubbless,"Just another bitter, resentful and spitefule post. Get the fuck over it,  I have and I voted Remain. We lost the vote and need to look foward... I am not sure if you are a 'Remainer' or an EU national, but honestly you are angrily spouting a minute fraction of 'Facts' and claiming its the whole story.Do you actually realise that the EU is only 16% of the world trade. Sure they are closer to us, which makes it easier, but there is a rich wealth of trade (84 fucking percent) in the world that we (the UK) can negociate with if the EU want to dick around (and hinder their own economy in the process).Is there any law that says we can't start those negotiations now to set up deals the day we leave the EU? I don't believe so, otherwise the EU wouldn't have to state their intentions not to negociate. Sure the EU won't talk, they've made that clear. But we have already had intent from the US, Australia and India in terms of trade agreements when we come to leave the EU (I read something about Germany also stating intent to trade, but I am not sure how that could work with them in the EU).Germany export a huge amount to the UK, they are not going to want huge tarrifs and loads of red tape to continue trade. They are quite a large power in the EU (especially with the UK's departure). You can always count on the germans to do the right thing, when it comes to securing its businesses needs.As for the question of the FTA agreement, thats not up for debate. We want a free trade agreement with the EU. The thing that is up for debate is the Freedom to move people. Saying that its ""part of the package"" is just nieve. Every single little chip is up for bartering. The EU will do what is best of them no matter what, the threats about ""You abide by the rules or no trade for you"" is just another crisis management tactic to avoid everyone in the EU from realising they might have a better 'better deal' by leaving. They'll compremise, its in their interests, not just ours alone.Also there are a lot of raw statistics flying around about how the UK exports less and imports large amounts from the EU (or the other way if you read some stats). But people don't tend to try to think of the whole picture and why the figures are the way they are.(Assuming that the figures people have been quoting aren't just a small portion or cross section of data that supports their argument)We export and import from the EU more than anywhere else in the world because.... Its cheaper at the moment.

So, the image itself does a good job of explaining how:a.) most changes of this scale or scope are determined not by a simple up and down vote but by some need for a super-majority;b.) the British people were in many cases mislead about Brexit;c.) by extension, the vote does not accurately reflect the will of the British people.I'll note that while democratic governance is nominally for the people, by the people, the point of government and parliamentary systems in the first place is to insulate the people from direct decision making. On some level, governments are expected to do what is best for the population (and the individuals), regardless of popular opinion. This is why leadership and decision making is delegated to representatives in the first place: to prevent mob mentality from subverting the democratic process. It doesn't always work, but you have checks and balances in place (like referendums not being legally binding) in place for precisely this reason.",d50g63v,4rceyu,4rceyu,0.726179954,0.452359907,Brexit,05-07-16

BoJo left the scene, he broke the china and is nowhere to be found anymore, a sign of a political coward and demagogue.

So that gives you till october at the very least.  At which point a new PM may invoke the article as their first official task.  At that point there would still be 2 years in which all agreements apply.  Given those 2 things, I'd be surprised if an actual brexit had happened before January 2018.  Sure there might be some uncertainty and some fluctuations due to some discussions - but nothing will change in a major sense.  Given the hesitation of article 50, and the task at hand, I'd even guess January 2019 before an actual Brexit happens - (If it happens at all).

Let's assume on this loan for 200k, they profit 50k for interest. In the great and good years, they profit the 50k because everyone pays the interest. In the normal/bad years, let's say home prices drop 10% (home is now worth 180k). Most people would still be able to pay up for their 190k mortgage and even if any defaulted, the bank would take a 10k hit topsIn the terrible year, let's say home prices drop 25% (home is now worth 150k).

There is enough air in that balloon that UK house price could drop by 30-50% in case the UK economy tanks.And with the uncertainty from the Brexit, such scenarios have become more likely, whereas ""good"" years for the real estate market have become less likely.The next point to know is how banks work. If a bank gives somebody 200k to buy a house, about 16k-20k will be covered by the bank's own money, but the bulk will be money the bank has borrowed. If the bank then loses 20k on an individual mortgage, that will wipe out the bank's whole investment, rather than merely 10% of it.

8850,2,cluo40,"I vastly oversimplified the example for the sake of my argument but you're right in that interest is not profit. A bank's minimum T1 leverage ratio is 3%. In reality, they don't cover much of any of total loan but rather today's money just shuffles around due to incredibly high liquidity. Mortgages are bundled and sold off for future cash flows to other entities through MBS or even individual loans. By bundling them together, they are leveraged higher but at the same time, this also helps cut losses. One failing cash flow out of a bundle won't do anything to hurt the overall prices. I think it was 14% or so that would have to fail during 2008 to cause a collapse of the whole MBS. In 2016, repo rate was at 0.09% in the UK so we've got a long way to go if you're thinking of another bubble collapse. Additionally, in my ""terrible"" scenario, nobody is invested so heavily in MBS that they would go bankrupt off it. In fact, new laws are so stringent in the US that there are significant constraints to prevent companies from picking up too much of their portfolio in MBS. However, completely private investors like hedge funds might be much more leveraged. Lastly, it's not banks that would be exposed. Top tranches of MBS go mainly to asset managers. The investment grade stuff is great for pensions, endowments, etc. The lower tranches/strange stuff goes to hedge funds or more risk-loving investors. I never said that UK home prices wouldn't fall. In fact, it absolutely will fall and it already has with huge hedge fund redemptions in the housing market.

8899,2,Appleplex,"I Rape Brexit. ""Brexit, pursued by a bear"" [The Little Review](http://www.thelittlereview.com/current-affairs/brexit-pursued-by-a-bear)For the first time since 1940, the eyes of the world are on Britain. Concern about the future because of Brexit has dug up the question underneath it all. Why anyone would want to Remain in the UK at all?Britain's decision to Leave the European Union may have been its way of saying it's the greatest country in the world, but wasn't it really its people's reaction to the miserable prospect of a lifetime confined to the British Isles? Or Lincolnshire, in the worst case scenario.Â As it's not possible for the majority to move abroad or cultivate themselves with closer continental ties, Britons came up with a Brexit debate in which they brainwashed themselves into thinking everyone else wants to be in their shoes, blaming the medicine to make their lives bearable.Â Then they made the squalid distraction official by caving in the tunnels to the greener grass of Calais. Now they're pleased to be under blockade.Â The Anglo-Saxons have pulled off the new Great Escape, which turns out to be a homespun Nazism. Working-class, flagbearing, fanciful, fun to be involved in, German in origin. Now the world isn't wondering how we'll respond to Hitler, it's eyeing us with suspicion until it can figure out what we're really all about. This was our whiningest hour.Â It's so bad in Britain they've officially used up their last excuse of blaming Europe. Next they'll have to admit they'd rather be French, but since that can't be, they can at least learn to be as rude and tell everyone else to sod off.Once upon a time Britain used to invade and conquer France almost constantly, as an excuse to get out of England. It only went the other way once, during the Norman Conquest, which was enough and the rest was going back. Now 1066 is a date of national dishonour, to be replaced in the calendar by our Independence Day under Nigel Farage.Either that or Brexit was about adding a momentary significance to people's lives by putting Britain at the centre of the news cycle.Â Or a jab like voting to name a Royal Research Ship 'Boaty McBoatface', but without anyone to come along afterwards and say 'no, don't be silly', because that person is Boris Johnson. There's something Divine about a working-class revolt being led by a man who resembles one of the cherubs painted on the ceiling of Bleinham Palace. There's a touch of Joan of Arc about Churchill's inspired, stripling successor.Â Brexit is truly historic because this is the first time the British government has been replaced by a social disturbance. Like a food fight in a public school when the lights are out, voters overthrew the responsible culture from behind the anonymity of the secret ballot. What are you left with? An Eton mess.Â A conundrum as beyond scholars as Shakespeare's enigmatic stage direction, made without supporting evidence from the text. ""Exit, pursued by a bear"". Now we're wondering what grizzly apparition will appear next in the state of Denmark. All for a renaissance in high drama. Â The hardest thing to accept about important events like this is that they're meaningless. Like 9/11. The only safe thing to do is ignore them. Don't make things worse in the interests of further excitement. Like the Iraq War.Â Britons think a million Middle Easterners are headed to middle England to take advantage of the benefits system they rely on, forgetting that Syrians are fleeing a war zone and just want to be anywhere else. The last place on earth they want to be is England. Other than Wales.Â The British are just worried because they want to feel responsible. They see Europe as a corridor between themselves and the warzone they created with their social and financial pretensions under New Labour. When Tony Blair told George Bush there were weapons in return for a hotel full of strippers in Las Vegas. Or whatever your motive for cozying up to Blair was.Â They don't realise it's a comfortable living room in which one may relax without being immeasurably pissed or (if they've been to Europe) confiningly sunburned. No one goes to Britain on holiday. Other than London, on a stop-over through Heathrow on their way somewhere else.Â The British hate their country, with good reason, and their decision to Leave Europe is a nice example of the miserable whingeingness of everyday life there. Brexit was a Referendum on whether you thought Britain was a shit place, right now. And the people voted yes, in droves. Especially the wretched old ones.Â It offered them the temptation to get up in the morning and interfere in something which would have dramatic, visible consequences, without pulling the handle of a fruit machine. The answer was not to leave Europe but to take them on a channel ferry. But that's what happens when you gamble on democracy. The jackpot.Â If you've forgotten what kind of a place Britain is you clearly haven't arrived in Heathrow airport from somewhere else in the world in recent years. Neither have I fortunately, but I've done it enough times to know nothing ever changes.Â It's cold, it's probably raining outside the gangway, you can see your own breath, it's dark even though it's eight o'clock inÂ the morning, and everyone else pushing a trolley down the windy underground passageways in a yellow bib is a Pakistani. Hardly the vision of Arcadian England the Leave campaign want to cordon themselves off in in perpetuity.Â You'd think the racists who untied the barge of state from its continental moorings would want to stay in the EU, if only to dilute its current profile with a measure of immigration from Poland, White Russia perhaps, the formerly Fascist ally of Italy, or mildly suntanned (because the rain falls mainly on the plain there) Spaniards. But they won't shift bags at Heathrow. They'd rather remain in Spain with 50% unemployment than give up the siesta. Until recently Fascists themselves, they'd rather stay on their own dole and blame Moroccans. So who's going to rescue Lincolnshire?Â As for the Remain camp, aren't they the ones whose idea of Britain in the EU is themselves plushly relocating to Tuscany, or else they're the half the voting block who have been visiting for the last three generations from Pakistan. Fair play to them. British Muslims are the only dynamic block who are making achievements in a positive direction, like providing most of the doctors in the NHS. Who are now being paid like baggage handlers.Â Muslims are the only group who want to remain in Britain by something like constructive choice, as opposed to being born somewhere and not moving because your football team needs your support on the terraces.Â The millions of white people who want to put the Great back in Britain seem to have forgotten it all started because people wanted to live somewhere else, like Europe, or everywhere but Britain.Â The British Empire was founded because Britain was so fundamentally crap, and not overseas. It was also poor then, it was cold, it was miserable, and everyone was just as ugly and drunk in Barnstable and Scunthorpe.Â In contrast the mangos genuinely ripened in Ceylon, the natives were friendly and had better dentistry, and in Greece Byron could practice sodomy without being sent to jail in Reading or bothering his screeching wife.Â The happiest experience of his life was being expelled from England forever for giving her a stye. Keats, Shelley and even Wordworth didn't find inspiration on the Continent because they had been banned from hanging around in Bodmin or The Wash.It was only after Wordsworth dipped in the French Revolution (where he got his rocks off) that we got English Romanticism, only to lose it in endless revisions of his boggy Prelude in the torrential Lake District (dragging Coleridge along by the Daffodils, drugged to the eyeballs). We owe 'Xanadu' to its opposite, Cumbria. And the heroin you need to live there.Â ""I wandered lonely as a cloud..."". A cloud. There are reasons why an Empire on which the sun never set never began in Jamaica. Or Australia. Or liveable lands like Italy, or - wait, I wonder why the Romans bothered...Ah wait, that's right, it was because they thought Europe was worth being part of. The Roman Empire was the first European Union. They built a wall, much like Trump, to keep the Scottish out. Even Boudiccea didn't mind being bent over by Caesar that much, or Britannia wouldn't have stayed in bed with known civilization for four hundred years. So why not our Queen, by Germany?Â After the last dark ages it took the Norman Conquest to wake Britain up, but now we've rebarricaded Hastings for the first time since the Battle of Britain, when we saved the continent so we could have nothing to do with it ever again.Â I know what's good about Britain. Egg and chips. Spots. (There's a familiar, cherished connection between the two). Hooliganism. Benidorm. Gibraltar. Hong Kong. Or anywhere but there, except possibly Wimbledon. Unless you mean the place or the former football team with John Fashanu.Â Try kebabs, curry houses, banging your French exchange, Gauloises, crossing the channel by boat without a bayonet, and the bidet. Kebabs are Turkish, which is Europe (like Britain, you can swim there from the mainland, the true definition alongside participation in the first world war), and in time closer ties to France would result in improved practices of anal hygiene for all (except in public conveniences).Â The Brexiters are right about one thing. With the modern global internet economy we don't need trading deals with Europe, we can get everything directly online from the rest of the world. Porn, for example. French companies like Private no longer feature as prominantly in our marketplace since the obsolescence of VHS.Â Gone are the days of George Orwell's Paris, when all French literature transported to London was automatically confiscated on suspicion of its primary use as British pornography. For Lady Chatterley to stay in print there's no longer any need for a French publisher. To hell with them.Â Only recently everyone wanted to leave Britain. Now they're rioting to have it all to themselves. But if there was a third option on the ballot, 'Leave the EU, Remain, or Move To Malta', there would be a less polarised landscape. Malta wouldn't Remain in the EU for long though, not with all the immigrants taking over.Â ""First slum of Europe, with a cast of crooks and tarts"". Europe. Phillip Larkin may have been complaining, but at least he knew geography. The countryside is still designed for motorists, and the national painting is a poster of the Tube map. The only thing Brexit has changed is a well-deserved excuse.Â ",NA,NA,4rh3nb,1,1,Brexit,06-07-16

They do not reflect the perceived value of the total value of good in the economy.  That is, you can derive that a company with 1000 shares at $100 a share is 'worth' (speculatively) $100,000.  That is not the case for currencies.  A lot of the value of money is determined by FX speculative markets - meaning people holding GBP are selling them now before prices drop further.

Leavers will of course say we are better off, and pick isolated stats which appear to show that's the case. But there will be a generally downwards economic decline.But the UK will be an increasingly small voice on the world stage. We'll cling to our ""special relationship"" with the USA, but they will mostly pay us lip-service in return.Unemployment in the UK will be rife. Our manufacturing industries (what's left of them) will collapse and London and Birmingham will be the main cities providing services. But being outside of the EU, they will be up against stiff competition from EU nations. The abolition of the minimum wage allows them to remain competitive, though.The North of England, the South West, and Wales will essentially be large population centres with mass unemployment and no prospects. Scotland will be talking heavily about  breaking away, if they have not yet already done so. Similar demands will rise in Northern Ireland; exacerbated by increasing poverty there. Eventually, the sectarian violence will resume: started by Loyalists. A unified Ireland referendum is still a decade or two away at this point, but it's already inevitable and unwinnable by loyalists. They know that, and can see it (which is what triggers the return to violence in the first place).England and Wales will continue to struggle along. They will discuss applying to rejoin the EU, but will be put down quite sharply by both French and German premiers, on the grounds that they caused so much trouble last time.As the economy declines further still, extremist political parties will rise. Whether England and Wales go to the left or to the right wing is anybody's guess, but I think right-wing is more likely. We will remain an important military base for the USA, though, and we will no longer be constrained by things like the ECHR or the Human Rights Act.

His Loan to Value (LTV) is 90% and he has a 2 year fixed rate about 2.5% aka Â£800 a month in repayments (also average for the market atm).Bam Brexit hits and house prices begin to fall over the course of a year. He is blissfully ignorat of this because he's chilling in his fixed rate for another year.A year later his house has dropped to Â£100,000 but his loan value remains at 178,000 (generous estimate of the amount you pay off a debt in the first year of a 25 year mortgage with a 90% LTV). Ok its fine he's in his fixed rate for another year, no worries.A year rolls round and the house market has since stabalised a bit and begun to recover at a price increase of 10% a year (about what it currently is increasing).So Jeff comes out of his fixed rate and is hit with his variable rate of 4.5% (a realistic variable after leaving a fixed at 2.5%), his monthly payments go up to about Â£1000 a month. Jeff thinks, no worries I will remortgage and use my equity to lower my LTV. Oh shit, no he can't. He has negitive equity, he house is worth 110,000 but he has a loan or 168,000. The Â£20,000 he saved in the years leading up to buying a house is gone and he now owes the bank Â£68,000 more than is house is worth. He can't sell his house, because he can't afford to pay off the mortgage debt. He is stuck paying Â£200 a month more for his mortgage and risking potencial increases by way of interest rates on the variable.Not to mention, he isn't going to step up on the property ladder any time soon, as he needs to clear that debt, the kid on the way is going to have to sleep in mummy and daddys room for the next 10 years.But hey it's fine, a first time buyer now who has saved the same deposit can buy a house similar to Jeff's, can jump into a 90% mortgage and pay about half as much a month (90% LTV on a house worth 110,00 at a 2.5% rate = Â£500 a month).Life is great for Jeff.____I'd rather be a first time buyer than Jeff in this situation.",d52upu6,d52r0yr,4rhc4v,0.999934358,0.999868717,Brexit,07-07-16

Just as most people in the UK wouldn't give a damn if Britain was in a position of power and they decided to fuck over the EU (which is what farage is still trying to do). The EU only has to tell people that it's either the UK getting less or people in the EU getting less. Self preservation would kick in and suddenly the UK is not their concern anymore. Especially given the fact that Farage is still planning on openly undermining the EU at every corner. Hard to bring up sympathy for that and this will play a role in how much people care about the people of Britain. And in Belgium I have a feeling that most think the Brits made this choice out of selfishness so I wouldn't count to much on empathy.Option 2: They give the UK a good deal and risk other countries leaving the EU if the UK does well.If I had to bet money on one of those, it would be option 1.

9039,2,Elder_Yautja,"Well lets see the Federal Reserve increased the supply of base currency from about $800 billion to almost $4 *trillion* with 3 successive rounds of QE. That's hyperinflation. That's 500% inflation in less than a decade.We are not seeing the *effect* of this inflation on price of goods in the US because the banks are just sitting on it its not entering circulation. Its velocity is effectively zero. So US banks are basically sitting on a tsunami of backed up price inflation just waiting to be unleashed, and that's just base currency that's the M1 (or M0 I can't remember if the scale starts at 0 or 1). Add in M2 and M3 and that's a hell of a lot of potential. All they need is a reason to release even some of this currency into general circulation under the banner of ""stimulus"".Or what about falling dollar demand internationally? The US is the only country in the world with more of its national currency outside of its borders than inside. That makes it vulnerable because if, for any number of reasons (loss of confidence in US bonds, inflation due to stimulus, BRICS circumventing the dollar) then you have instant price inflation in the domestic US markets because dollars that have been abroad for years come flooding back.It wouldn't even need to be as severe as that. The Fed raised rates from 0 to 0.25% (a token gesture I know). They already *haven't raised them* again (had they stuck to their original schedule, we should have had at least another 0.25% hike), but what if they had to back pedal and lower them back to 0%? Functionally I know there's no much difference between 0 and 0.25%, but it would spook the anyone with a brain cell and holding dollar denominated assets. The dollar is traditionally a bit of a ""safe haven"" asset but the reality it has royally painted itself into a corner and that makes it vulnerable.",d536evg,d5354tk,4rjkx5,0.010074695,-0.97985061,Against,07-07-16

9076,2,UnmixedGametes,"2% decline in GDP for 10 years. Recession for 7 years. Property market falls back 30%, except in London where the low GBP encourages foreign buyers. Finance sector stays in London, but is hollowed out and sheds 20,000 jobs a year overseas. UK loses right to settle Euro trades. Tax base drops accordingly.  Govt renege on all promises to invest in N England, NHS or education. Military spending rises sharply.To pump growth, successive governments continue to encourage 250k immigrants a year, increasingly from collapsed Islamic nations and N Africa.Low GBP encourages small export rises from manufacturing, but standard of living falls as High-tech and enabling EU and US imports so expensive. Lack of access to latest machinery and tools (they are now 20% to 30% more expensive) begins to cripple UK business. IPhones and BMWs become status symbols for the 1%, as they jump 30% up in price. China, the only source of ""cheapish"" imports runs a huge balance of trade imbalance with the U.K., and uses its GBP reserves to buy large UK tech companies and close them to move to China. U.K. Loses tech edge in about 20 years and becomes only a source of cheap labour, music and comedy.Service industries struggle and wither as they find travel harder and constantly lose out to ""conforming businesses"" with single market rights.UK is forced to sign a bad version of TTIP (US demands this or won't sell us Trident). This results in the rapid erosion of the NHS, local govt services, and environmental protection. UK agriculture collapses (UK Govt can't fund subsidies). Major UK companies fall into US hands because of ISDS fines and they close and move to China.Bank of England exhausts its ability to provide quantitative easing and inflation slowly grows, however deflation of wages, house prices and industrial investment means that standard of living erodes instead of inflation rising sharply.Fishing restarts briefly, then exhausts the already damaged stocks which collapse to zero.Rise of far right is rapid and causes regular problems. Tory party becomes increasingly right wing. Terrorists thrive in NI, Scots border, Australia, Scotland, NI all leave the UK/ Commonwealth. Others follow. There are no ""rescue deals"" with Australia / Canada / NZ as they have nothing to offer and we have nothing they want. Gibraltar is given back to Spain, Falklands to Argentina. Trade with India booms, but never replaces lost EU trade.UK education, starved of investment and foreign students, implodes, and Uni entry rates fall from 40%+ to 25% or less of 18-19 year olds. Rise in old style ""apprenticeships"" to replace that.Pension industry suffers huge collapse and state pension is decoupled. Combined with dropped house values, this leads to massive poverty among the elderly, overflowing hospitals and spread of low quality elderly care.UK police get large funding boost and are routinely armed, as increasingly authoritarian governments demand they ""crack down on dissent""Unemployment rises towards 11%, especially among the young and unskilled. Robots and AI already starting to take over huge numbers of jobs. So inside 30 years unemployment (in the traditional meaning) skyrockets.Working Time controls repealed, Agency Workers Rights repealed, holidays reduced, minimum wage never again increased, health and safety at work subtly weakened. All in all the ""bonfire of regulations"" falls entirely on the workers.Fees introduced for medical, education, social and other services. Mostly under US or German ownership. LGBTQ rights downgraded. Mass surveillance targets Union leaders and environmental groups first. With Scotland gone, and N England cities declining, Tory party quickly rewrites boundaries and it becomes mathematically impossible to remove them from Government. Having fallen over 22%, while others gained, the UK loses its G8 place, and is now ranked 9th in the world, down from 5th pre-Brexit.After a 10 year enquiry, it is discovered that Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and David Cameron were Russian sleeper agents. Investigators in Europe (now slimmed to 8 core members and an outer group of 19) reveal that huge amounts of money flowed from Putin into UKIP and Boris Johnson's trust fund in Panama.

There could be an open and honest discussion about pros and cons of being a member of a greater European Union. A mature discussion with facts, projections, ideas. Not lies, half truths, simplifications, empty promises, fear, scare and what have you. An honest discussion where a mature democracy talks about their future, lays out realistic options. Then the UK could make a choice which of the options to pursue, maybe as part of a general election, or maybe in form of a referendum that gives a mandate to a group of accountable leaders to execute towards the selected option.I wish one of the options were a UK being a strong and constructive member of the European Union, where all EU members reap the benefits of the Union and work hard to get rid of the flaws and problems today's EU has. This is something the EU has to do anyway, I would appreciate if a strong UK would be part of this process.Yes, maybe I describe something Utopian.

His Loan to Value (LTV) is 90% and he has a 2 year fixed rate about 2.5% aka Â£800 a month in repayments (also average for the market atm).Bam Brexit hits and house prices begin to fall over the course of a year. He is blissfully ignorat of this because he's chilling in his fixed rate for another year.A year later his house has dropped to Â£164,000 but his loan value remains at 178,000 (generous estimate of the amount you pay off a debt in the first year of a 25 year mortgage with a 90% LTV). Ok its fine he's in his fixed rate for another year, no worries.A year rolls round and the house market has since stabalised a bit and begun to recover at a price increase of 10% a year (about what it currently is increasing).So Jeff comes out of his fixed rate and is hit with his variable rate of 4.5% (a realistic variable after leaving a fixed at 2.5%), his monthly payments go up to about Â£1000 a month. Jeff thinks, no worries I will remortgage and use my equity to lower my LTV. Oh shit, no he can't. He has negitive equity, he house is worth 164,000 but he has a loan or 178,000. The Â£20,000 he saved in the years leading up to buying a house is gone and he now owes the bank Â£14,000 after selling his house. He can't sell his house, because he can't afford to find Â£14,000 and be homeless with no savings. He can't remortgage because of the negitive equity, his LTV is over 100% now, so no way. He is stuck paying Â£200 a month more for his mortgage (Â£1000 total) and risking potencial increases by way of interest rates on the variable.Not to mention, he isn't going to step up on the property ladder any time soon, as he needs to clear that debt, the kid on the way is going to have to sleep in mummy and daddys room for the next 10 years.But hey it's fine, a first time buyer now who has saved the same deposit can buy a house similar to Jeff's, can jump into a 90% mortgage and pay about half as much a month (90% LTV on a house worth 110,00 at a 2.5% rate = Â£500 a month).Life is great for Jeff.____",d5411aq,d52x6sk,4rhc4v,0.999991863,0.999983725,Brexit,08-07-16

9123,2,spottybotty,"Saying they would do *anything* five years ago was always decried as ""really pushing it"". I should know: I was decrying along with the best of 'em.17.4 million people voted leave. At the last election, UKIP got 3.8 million votes. So we know that the ""leave"" camp had UKIP plus 13.6 million people. If *half* of those people add their votes to UKIP in 2020, annoyed because A50 hasn't been invoked, then that translates to 10.6 million votes for UKIP which (again using 2015 as a baseline) puts them between the Tories and Labour. But those votes have to come *from* somewhere, and will probably mostly come *from* the Tories.Which would give UKIP the highest vote in 2020 and - most likely - an overall majority.If just 25% of non-UKIP leave voters vote UKIP in 2020, that puts them as one of the big three, and probably in coalition with the Tories.So what you're betting is that: should the UK government ignore the referendum, then *less than 25%* of people who were not already in UKIP and who voted ""leave"" would issue a protest vote (or just directly switch to UKIP) in 2020.Given the passion behind the voting, I'd put it at between 25-40% as most likely. That puts UKIP in government ,no matter how you slice the numbers.Can you name one or two? [I cannot find any](http://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/elections/referendums-held-in-the-uk/).Absolutely.

Because that's how you make the UK look like that.No referendums have ever been ignored in the UK, though. Which is what I thought we were discussing. What other countries do is up to them, but the UK is a very different kettle of fish.In the second link, the Greek decision led to the imposition of terms on Greece which look very worrying and which could lead directly to the rise of the far-right there. Golden Dawn got [nearly 10% of the vote in 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn_(political_party\)#European_Parliament).

The ideal was to bring countries to trade with Britain, mine for resources etc. So trade was the overriding principal. With that in mind, bringing trade centres up to speed with road and rail infrastructure, education, abolition of slavery etc was a pretty important task. Religion tagged along, and with it came a pretty shitty attitude/intolerance towards the locals.It's understandable that there would be resistance from the locals, and resistance is bad for trade. In a harsh world, resistance has to be stamped out and there was no question about using the army to achieve this.My personal view is that there should be free movement and trade between our colonies and the U.K.Many of these countries stood up to be counted next to us during WW1 &amp; 2 and other campaigns.

9225,2,ArticulateT,"The thoughts of a typically a-political remain voter So, hi there!I wanted something to get this off my chest, mainly because the whole situation is greatly concerning me. To think that my first dedicated foray into the political world would be something so huge.Before I begin, I want to stress that this isn't a post decrying the voters of either side, neither is it something where I shout about what should be done, I'm just giving my perspective of the referendum, what it means to me, and what I believe may likely happen. This is mainly a thought piece, and all opinions are valid, I have no intention on calling anybody wrong (though, in the case of one individual, I feel like it might be needed).When the referendum was properly coming to the polls, I found myself already siding with remain, and it wasn't really down to anything specifically major or patriotic/treasonous, it was mainly down to the one piece of information I retained while in school. I remember seeing something regarding the history of Britain and Europe, and I remember one of the core reasons we entered the then Common Market was for economic reasons. There was likely something more complicated than that, but at the time I put myself in the Remain side, feeling that our departure would impact our economy negatively and since we really only just got out of a recession, didn't fancy another one.Oddly, as the campaign went on, I rarely heard anything about the remain campaign. People tell me it was mainly fear tactics, but from what I saw, the remain campaign was remarkably quiet, at least compared to those who wanted to leave.Speaking of, one of the major aspects of the leave campaign, that 350 mill a week thing? I can't say I was convinced by it. When I saw it, I started thinking about it mathematically, as simply stating 350 mill a week seemed odd. It was punchy and eye catching, sure, but odd. I thought to myself ""Well, alright, but how much do we get back? Do we spend this much per week after we calculate the trade and money we would get back from the EU, or is this just the standing fees we have to look into?"" I think the thing that tipped me off was the NHS part. I have family who work in the NHS, and the way they speak about how many troubles it runs into, as well as a recent plan to privatise or scrap it made me think it was a VERY significant turn to suddenly fund it again. In short, the statement at first didn't seem to grab me.So, when I looked into it more, I found the other platform upon which the Leave campaign sat: immigration.Now, I can't help but feel that I never saw immigration as an issue. Most of my friends are overseas, and I made a lot of friends at university who came to study from abroad. I remember growing up that there was something big about the polish at one point, but it never really came up much other than media and internet babble saying ""they were taking British jobs"". After I graduated from University, I spent several months trying to find a job, but the problem wasn't actually immigration, it was experience. See, there's a current catch-22 where a person won't be able to get a job because they lack experience, which they need the job to get, but can't because they don't have experience etc. Despite having a degree in Software Engineering, as well as (admittedly average) GCSEs and A-Levels, I wasn't able to even get interviews with certain jobs because I lacked industry experience. I spent roughly 3 or 4 years as a customer adviser because, at the time, they were the only ones who would take me.As you can imagine, I wasn't swung by the immigration platform either. I felt that the reason businesses would hire from abroad would be because doing so is cheaper and more effective than doing so from among the pool of citizens in the UK. In addition, it occurred to me that a lot of jobs less qualified immigrants would have would be jobs few British citizens actually wanted, such as caring for the elderly (harsh to say, yes, but possible. This isn't so much of a sweeping generalisation, either, I am aware the British aren't devoid of compassion or desire for needed work experience).So after those two, the one remainder (besides a hurt sense of national pride over not even getting a vote when going into the EU) was the laws applied to trade by the EU that seem odd/terrible/broken. This was the one thing I didn't really look into, but I couldn't help but feel that even if we left the EU, we would have to abide by those same trade laws, in a sense. I could be entirely wrong, but I imagined trade being an even-sided deal, ultimately meaning that while the UK would get more control, it wouldn't have complete control. It was later brought to my attention, that to enjoy anything near the trade capabilities we had, we would need to provide some level of freedom of movement, thereby putting the previous aspect of immigration into question.And so, the days rolled by. Other countries, both in and out of the EU, weighed in on what they thought was a good idea at the time. While I could understand that there's a patriotic sense that it was rude for others to tell us how to run our country, I also felt that, we're a very powerful nation with great influence, and our position in the world is important; leaving the EU would have potential global implications, for good or bad, so for other nations to weigh in on it was almost valid, as in a way it did concern them.When the results came in, I will admit to some level of anger, but mainly I was scared. For once I had genuinely paid attention to the political scene, made my vote in confidence and lost. As I spoke to others, a lot of them dismissed my desire to remain as being unaware of a period of time the UK was outside the EU, but then, it wasn't that; My concern was economical, and as I watched the Pound and the FTSE drop that morning, I just grew sicker and sicker.The various leaders left their posts and I can feel drawn into the despair that many others have been in. I grew angrier and sicker as I saw posts about the google spike of 'what is the EU?' come to mind. I felt like I had to hold my tongue overhearing a young person say they didn't cast their vote because 'they didn't like either policy'.now, though, I feel less concerned, a bit more... resigned, I guess. As much as I dislike the result, a vote is a vote, and I won't disrespect it. I will admit, that if another referendum was held in the wake of this one, I wouldn't mind it, but if this truly is the will of the people, then let it be done. The campaigns were a mess, I can say that much; I never saw, from either side, what the plan would be if we left or stayed. I didn't see any leave campaigner stand and shout they had a thorough plan written and laid out on what to do, and I didn't see a remain campaigner explain what the benefits of staying would be and if we might change it. As I assess my future and think of what I might have to do to operate in the shaken markets, I find myself wondering ""Will the Commonwealth be enough? Will the referendum actually happen, and if not, will we have still damaged our ties with the world?""One thing is for sure, I have actively discovered someone whom I may actually 'hate' with a passion, and that would be Nigel Farage.Before I explain why, I want to make it clear: I am aware that the main front runners for the referendum's leave side were Johnson and Gove. I am aware that Farage was mainly acting with them rather than leading them (I think). It wasn't about his role in the campaign, whether he is or isn't an actual racist or the policies of his party.What I take issue with is how he acted at the summit.I do not care if he is a 'decent bloke' in conversation, I don't care about his previous skill. You do not insult and bully other diplomats. This is not how adults act, let alone politicians. Considering the turbulent time in which this has taken place, literally poking the bear at this juncture was a terrible, terrible move. As the result came about, I took some solace in that we might have acquired a deal similar to Norway or just able to have a decent relationship with the EU, but all Farage had done is make it worse. Such a thing made me furious, how he could be such a sore winner, and then days later, step down as leader of UKIP, making it clear to me that he spent 17 years fighting for something without so much as a political benefit in mind. Was leaving the EU the right move? i don't know. Did Farage know? I'm guessing not. Considering the fact that he didn't speak out about the NHS platform being false before the referendum happened, and despite stating that a non-majority win would leave unfinished business, him stepping down from his position in UKIP after making a complete fool of himself at the summit like a petulant child made me think he likely had no intention on helping move the country in a proper direction after it became independent. All he cared for was to make the UK leave, for good or ill, and I doubt that it will ever sit well with me.What I think will happen? Well, a part of me feels that we are unlikely to leave, unless Leadsom were to become PM. yes, it would be an affront to democracy and the position of PM is basically the most significant poisoned chalice that could possibly be imagined. I don't know if the Queen has any political power beyond that, though I am still unaware on her stance.I have few predictions, as my knowledge of the political landscape is very limited, but I can only assume that the Pound will drop to be one to one with the Euro, if not the Dollar, by about October when a new leader is being selected. While our stance with the euro might not go up much, if Trump is elected and he genuinely sets about building the wall and leaving the TPP like he promises, the value of the Dollar may also drop, bringing it back to where it currently sits.Well... those are my thoughts. I don't want it to be decrying other voters, at least while I was writing I wasn't aiming to do that. This was mainly just me writing out my thoughts in a way to clear my head of the matter.",NA,NA,4rwes2,1.67E-14,-1,Against,08-07-16

The EU has exerted its influence on the UK and effected its immigration policies. This may not bother you, and that's completely fine. In fact, it may benefit you (if you are a business owner) and you may be fully in favor of it.It's not the immigration laws themselves that are the problem, it's the fact that *the UK has lost some control over its ability to choose them for itself*.It is altogether possible (and I would even say likely) that the EU forces a law on the UK that you *do* find objectionable. You would have no way of stopping it. Your MEPs don't have enough power to change EU policy. You'd be powerless. The only reason you don't care now is because you don't care about immigration. The next issue could easily be something that you do care about.And Nigel Farage is a hero that will go down in history as one of the greatest Britons who has ever lived. It's rude to tell the truth sometimes, and he might even choose to go too far. At the heart of it, he's fighting for what he truly believes in. He's fighting for democracy. Is there any nobler goal?Look at all the people criticizing Trump. The media, other politicians, etc. Are all those people rude, also? If not, then why is Farage rude when he criticizes the EU?

I still do not think the man is a 'hero'. A lot of the information I had is based off of somewhat basic summaries of the event, but I have since watched the speech he made at the summit. Watching the speech though, accusing a room of several hundred people that they've ""never worked a day in their lives,"" and opening with, what might be tantamount to ""Nee-ner-nee-ner-nee-ner"" is not the basis of a decent diplomatic adjustment. I am aware that representatives in that room have a very strained relationship with the man, considering their disposition to him during this time. In the course of acting as a gentleman and in the interests of future diplomatic relations, it is important to be graceful in victory. You also have to remember, that he has, in the past, attempted to justify the racist behaviour of his party members (I think I remember him claiming a slur for a chinese person is a colloquialism for chinese food when it was brought to his attention that a prominent member of UKIP used it when describing a person?) instead of identifying the issue and rectifying it.I can admit that I am likely part of a smaller group who do not see Farage as a great man, and I will admit to fighting for democracy is good thing, but think about it this way: how far will you fight for democracy before it ceases to be democracy anymore? To what point do the ends cease to justify the means?In regards to Trump, perhaps the media are being rude about him, but there's also a difference between delivering criticism like an adult, and berating something in a vicious manner. In addition, Trump himself isn't free from being rude, bigoted or simply, factually wrong. You have to remember, for Farage to go down in history as a hero, then the Brexit will need to be a positive. Right now, no one knows what it is and everyone is panicking as the pound loses its value. If this does end up damaging our economic stability in the long term and leaving the EU turns out to be a bad thing, then Farage, Johnson, Gove and Cameron will likely go down in history as hated politicians almost as infamous as Thatcher.",d54yd9z,d54wznj,4rwes2,9.59E-05,-0.999808285,Against,09-07-16

The Commission has Representations in all EU Member States and 139 Delegations across the globe.1 President, 7 Vice-Presidents and 20 CommissionersA new team of 28 Commissioners (one from each EU Member State) is appointed every five years.The candidate for President of the Commission is proposed to the European Parliament by the European Council that decides by qualified majority and taking into account the elections to the European Parliament.The Commission President is then elected by the European Parliament by a majority of its component members (which corresponds to at least 376 out of 751 votes).Following this election, the President-elect selects the 27 other members of the Commission, on the basis of the suggestions made by Member States. The final list of Commissioners-designate has then to be agreed between the President-elect and the Council. The Commission as a whole needs the Parliament's consent. Prior to this, Commissioners-designate are assessed by the European Parliament committees.The current Commission's term of office runs until 31 October 2019. Its President is Jean-Claude Juncker.More on how the Commissioners workEthics and transparencyThe European Union's activities today affect millions of European citizens' lives. The decisions affecting them must be taken as openly as possible.Ethics and transparencyRegular and emergency meetingsThe Commissioners meet as a College once a week, usually on Wednesday, in Brussels. The College agendas are determined by the President.When the Parliament holds its plenary sessions in Strasbourg, the Commissioners usually meet there. The agenda for each meeting is based on the Commission's work programme. The meetings and debates are not open to the public, but the agendas and minutes are available.The Commission also meets when emergencies need to be addressed and when major issues are being discussed by the Council of Ministers.How the Commission worksCommission rules of procedureDirectorates-General and agenciesThere are 23 000 staff members working in the Commission in departments, known as Directorates-General (DGs) or services, each responsible for a particular policy area and headed by a Director-General.The DGs draft laws, but their proposals become official only once the College of Commissioners adopts them during its weekly meeting.The DGs also manage funding initiatives at EU level, carry out public consultations and communication activities.The Commission also administers a number of executive agencies, which help the European Commission manage EU programmes.Documents, statistics and surveysAccess to documentsRegisters of documents from the Commission and other institutions, as well as archives, registers of comitology (committees of national representatives), expert groups and more.Green PapersDiscussion documents to stimulate debate and consultationsWhite PapersConcrete Commission proposals for EU actionEurostatOfficial EU statisticsEurobarometer surveysPublic opinion polls on EU issuesAn eco-friendly Commission (EMAS)The Commission sets an example by reducing the environmental impact of its own activities through EMAS.

9297,2,Brit-a-Canada,"Why I voted out - and how does the EU work anyway? Every time I tell someone I voted out:1. There's at first a look of denial2. Then shock and disbelief3. Proceeded by a sceptical attempt to understand why4. Followed by some dooms day comments about the UK5. And then acceptance that the issue is not straight forwardMost people didn't even know how the EU functioned politically when they voted, and still don't even know how it works now. I decided to look into it, and it's why, with a very, very heavy heart, I voted out.**So, what exactly is the EU?**As you know, it started off as mostly a free trade arrangement in order to promote peace (through economical interdependence). The UK opted in later, during the thatcher era! As time went on, it developed into a political union. Whilst not technically a federal union, it's pretty much heading in that direction. I'm not actually against that idea, I would like to see a fully democratic union. UEU or Europada? We could have a living wage across the EU which would solve many of the problems.**So, what are the political structures and how do they work?**There are three main ones with power: the Council, the Parliament, and the Commission.1. Council (""legislative body""): As I understand it, ministers from each country meet and can approve or veto legislation passed to them. For example, when trying to mandate free health care EU wide, all 28 (well 27 now) health care ministers would meet to approve laws).= something vaguely akin to senators in the US system.2. Parliament (""legislative body""): Every country elects representatives, the share of which depends on, of all things, treaties with your country. Like the council, this body approves/vetos legislation only. If they do not respond within enough time, the Council may bypass this body.= something vaguely akin to the house of Representatives in the US system.3. Commission (""executive body""): This is my favourite part of the EU (not!). This body is made up of 28 (now 27) appointed people, one for each country. How they are removed is not clear to me, if they even get removed at all. It's meant to be the EXECUTIVE body -  think obama - but it is kind enough to handle creating all the legislation, trade deals and war/humanitarian decisions. At least it still needs to get legislation passed by the Council and maybe Parliament... which turns out not to be too hard when all your friends sit on the Council and the largest majority of representatives in the Parliament are, by treaty, German, French, Italy and Spain (Although the UK had a large chunk too to be fair). So yeah, our executive body seems to do, well, everything! And it's not even elected!The president of the Commission, who may as well be the president of the EU, *is appointed by the 28 countries' leaders. (S)he has to negotiate with the country leaders for the appointed commissioners, but can assign them to whatever political roles s(he) desires.* (S)he must be able to speak French (or France will shit a brick making life difficult for Germany). That limits our choice of president to France, Belgium or other vaguely French speaking countries in that area.**What about the events happening in the news within the EU?**A. Meanwhile, the situation in Greece is certainly frown worthy. Sure, the Greek government, and thus the people, mismanaged their finances. But to demand they make themselves so poor that young people end up sitting around jobless in their millions... I mean, do we really hate Greek people this much? There must be a better way. Greece cannot obviously devalue the euro to encourage tourism to help itself out of debt. We could subsidize it instead to make holidays artificially cheap there until their economy recovers, but the EU just won't go for that. Cos punishment is better I guess.B. Canada didn't originally want to allow Romanians and Bulgarians visa free access. Since the UK needs the EU to conduct trade deals with Canada, and trade deals must be approved unanimously by all 28 countries AND that neither Romania nor Bulgaria will agree unless Canada grants them visa free access - the UK was unable to ever establish a free trade deal. I think Canada recently agreed and will now allow the visa free travel. Thus, something that has nothing to do with trade had become a show stopper for everyone else, even countries outside the EU.C. Countries like Germany, France and even the UK enjoy cheap labour from the EU east for jobs that locals won't do for what is basically a nonsense wage for living in that western country. As things are much cheaper in the east, Eastern Europeans can easily send a small slice back to their families and it will mean a lot. I'm not against that in itself, but what I object to is that it hurts the local lower class workers in these western countries because if you live here and you're poor - who wants to work for minimum wage just to scrape by? Is it really that hard to understand why those we look down on as the thick, uneducated and lazy Brexiters are so angry by the situation? They themselves don't even understand the cycle that has been set up, but they just see that jobs they typically held have been replaced with immigrants. And hence it gives rise to xenophobia.D. Related to the last point, many Eastern Europeans, in return, enjoy the generous welfare benefits from these countries, able to send money back to their families even though they're not living in the UK and live in a country that has vastly different living costs. The problem here is that yet more money is pouring out of the country away from the UK rather unnecessarily. How is this a good thing for Britain?E. The EU has done a piss poor job of handling the refugee situation. Germany basically lead the EU into opening the flood gates without even consulting other countries. Many of the refugees are coming in from dire conditions to go onto waiting lists years long, as countries like Greece are already over burdened with debt. A proportion of the refugees are really just economic migrants from elsewhere than Syria - but the silly EU is doing nothing to filter them out, so they are contributing to the problem of the waiting lists and social resources etc, at the expense of genuine Syrians, and creating resentment of refugees.F. As for immigration, why has it worked so well in Canada and so badly elsewhere? Simple: If you don't have a decent education and clean criminal record, you aren't getting in to Canada! There's no immediate access to benefits (so you have to really want to move there for a better life) and if you commit a crime, you'll never get permanent residence or citizenship. This is how a nation of so much cultural diversity manages to exist in such a harmonious state. I'd love to see something like this in Europe, although we do need to clean our own house first, as it seems a good chunk of the EU is as thick as two short planks.How do I support such an idea in the EU? I have no democratic voice. And with a few unelected officials deciding to allow basically anyone in, on the basis that even mentioning the idea of a system like Canada's would amount to racism (a phenomena known as the ""regressive left""), what choice do I have? My mother can no longer go out to her local shop 350m away from her house after 7pm because gangs of foreigners from somewhere in the EU patrol and mug people who go near. One can see incidences of mass rape in Sweden and Germany and yet the police do nothing out of fear of being seen as racists. You don't hear incidences like this in Canada.**Fin**I find what a lot of these leave supporters are doing to the large amount of good foreigners in the UK an absolute disgrace! It's disgusting. I have at least three friends living in London who are from the EU, I'd hate to think someone would abuse them the way I've seen abuse lately. It was also why I had such a tough time voting. I'm pretty much voting against their interests, my families interests, my country's short term economical interests... I studied the issue for probably 12 hours total, even on the day I wasn't sure, and I'm still not. But can you imagine the bottom of the unelected EU boot stamping on the face of the UK forever and ever? I'm just not sure it's something I can say yes to. The UK is gonna suffer a lot for a while. But I hope in the end the social, democratic and other problems get sorted. It's a risk I think is worth taking.*Edit: Italics show where I edited to correct wrong information (currently: how the commissioners and president are appointed)*Just to add: my main reason for voting out is solely the lack of democracy within the EU and the unwillingness to discuss things like free movement and immigration among the EU politicians. The only reason I critise immigration as it works in the EU currently is that as someone who now lives in Canada, I believe Canada has a better system of stricter immigration that has lead to a better society.",NA,NA,4rywj1,1,1,Brexit,09-07-16

This is the reply sent by email by the FCO in reply to emails calling for a second Brexit referendum.    ""The European Union Referendum Act received Royal Assent in December 2015, receiving overwhelming support from Parliament. The Act did not set a threshold for the result or for minimum turnout.  The EU Referendum Act received Royal Assent in December 2015. The Act was scrutinised and debated in Parliament during its passage and agreed by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. The Act set out the terms under which the referendum would take place, including provisions for setting the date, franchise and the question that would appear on the ballot paper. The Act did not set a threshold for the result or for minimum turnout.  As the Prime Minister made clear in his statement to the House of Commons on 27 June, the referendum was one of the biggest democratic exercises in British history with over 33 million people having their say. The Prime Minister and Government have been clear that this was a once in a generation vote and, as the Prime Minister has said, the decision must be respected.   We must now prepare for the process to exit the EU and the Government is committed to ensuring the best possible outcome for the British people in the negotiations.

Yes I was fooled on the immigration argument by the right. If anything, the people committing the mass rapes in Sweden were claimed to be refugees, and not immigrants. No idea how we filter out refugees when they turn up with nothing. In this case, I suggest we run free education classes for them designed to teach them English, and to introduce them to the culture (aka show them events like pride, talk about a history of women's rights, etc). Give people a heads up as to what is and isn't acceptable before they begin.Still, Canada is very picky with immigration. I had to jump through hoops and hoops to be allowed to stay. It's lead to one of the most diverse, and intelligent countries in the world.I'm not sure I agree with letting a random bunch of people run the country for a couple of years at a time. The majority of people aren't just misinformed on issues (perhaps like I have been). They're literally dumb racists who can't add two numbers above 5. At least with a representative portion of the government, it filters out anyone who really is beyond unsuitable.

That would have made the referendum result in real and immediate action.However, they could easily have voted the day after the referendum to repeal that part.The referendum was held but no action was specified as a result of it.

Random parliament will have disabled persons, it will have convicts, it will have drug addicts and all those other unacceptable groups that society is ashamed of, but they are part of our society and should have a voice in parliament who didn't read English in Oxbriidge.Lack of democracy, I'm Bavarian (just imagine a Gerxit with some of the 16 state voting to stay, back to the Deutscher Bund) living just across the border in Austria for ten years and can't vote except in city elections. 14% of those living in Austria face the same restriction. Can't remember the precentage of under-16-yr-olds, but they are also not allowed to vote despite them having to live the longest with parliament's decision. In Austria's parliament 13% of the members are also mayors in their hometown.

9361,2,GoetzKluge,"That depends. E.g. a parliament may decide that the promises (given before the referendum took place) turned out to be false or even were blunt lies. The democratically elected politicians then could decide to take the responsibility for not executing on the will of the majory, especially if the margin was narrow. ""Responsibility"" means, that politicians who act against a referendum can be voted out of office if the majority of voters would not accept the decision of their elected representatives.The point is that in a democracy the members of parliament will have to be prepared for their political career to be finished if they refuse to execute on the result of a referendum without convincing the voters with a [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/museum/comments/4r1w66/francisco_jos%C3%A9_de_goya_y_lucientes_the_sleep_of/) accepted by them.

Today's information technology provides us with lots of information coming in with ever increasing data rates. Information is abundant, but how about validation? The right not to be able to evaluate this enormous amount of information should not be taken away. The state is not our nanny. But messing up should at least be made a bit difficult, e.g. by means of not making referendums binding. Such a hurdle still can be passed, but the difficulty to jump over it helps to protect democracy.If, however, the people decide that not following the result of referendums *would* harm democracy, then they should make referendums binding.

As I pointed out earlier, immigrants have no connection whatsoever to the amount of crime in UK. Crimes are going to be committed, no matter what. Please correct me if I misunderstood, but I got the impression you think that rapes and other crimes committed by local people are better than crimes committed by immigrants? We need to treat the problem causing these crimes, doesn't matter who commits them.As for the cherry-picking method of immigration, what kind of system are you referring to? If you're referring to the Australian point-system, please have a look [here](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jun/01/brexiters-missing-point-australian-style-immigration-conservatives) and [here](http://theconversation.com/explainer-what-is-australias-points-system-for-immigration-26065).

From the overpaid civil servant to the (probably Polish) cafe worker who makes their lunch, the confidence in the system has been shaken.

9481,2,cluo40,"We agree that a recession is coming. However, I would like to add that a recession is only coming if Brexit is triggered. And no, confidence certainly is not everything when it comes to valuing a company. It plays a key role in the short term but in the long run, it's down to fundamentals to value a company but that is a bit besides the point since we're talking about the short term. What we're talking about here is two separate things. I'm talking about the stock market recovering because Brexit hasn't fully priced in fundamentally yet. You're focusing too much on the loss of confidence and how it correlates with the stock price of most big companies in the UK stock exchange. Let's break this down a little further with some companies from the STOXX600. If you look at Unilever, who sells food, they will continue to sell food in the UK because people have to eat to live. They're relatively unaffected which is why their stock price might even increase. If you look at Barclays, who's heavily invested affected by confidence, they of course do have a fundamental change and they're going to be down 20+% for a while. Additionally, a lot of companies in the STOXX600 or FTSE100 are international, meaning they do have some hedge against the UK economy going bad. So the overall change basically is that the stock market might even look good for a while because Brexit fears are temporarily put on hold from a stock market perspective. This can be further seen in volatility trading. Futures, VIX (vol index), Gold/Silver spots/futures, etc are all trending towards higher confidence in the markets atm simply because people are comfortable at the current level of the GBP. Overall, you're right about there being less confidence in the markets but this doesn't mean that the stock market can't rise. It's only 1 factor of the many that causes stock prices to rise or fall. If Brexit were to trigger, this confidence factor would turn into a fundamental factor, causing a permanent change, rather a temporary one. ",d58e6vs,d58dfrn,4sbvve,1.87E-10,-1,Against,11-07-16

9605,2,Alcobob,"Ah, i was guessing that would come up but i wasn't entirely sure.The whole fiasco with Greece is indeed a mayor problem but i disagree with Krugman on certain points.There are 2 topics that while connected need to be considered on their own: The export surplus and the Greece financial situation.The export surplus is actually very hard to tackle, as after all that surplus is not gained by Germany, but by companies in Germany. And how do you want to really reduce it? By export taxes, which in my opinion would not be compatible with the single market laws?Before the Euro, that wouldn't have been a problem because the exchange rates would have equalized it somewhat, but Germany can't just leave the Euro on a whim.The second issue is the bankruptcy of Greece (I call it that, as in my eyes Greece is effectively bankrupt) Again there is no simple solution. My gut sais that we should have let Greece and the financial institutions go bankrupt. It would have been a fresh start for Greece, but of course with some years of economic problems. If you want capitalism to work, you need the corrective measures of going bankrupt. The problem for Greece was that letting a few banks go bankrupt would have forced other banks to go down as well, cascading throughout Europe. Nobody was willing to let that happen. So the bad Greek bonds had to go somewhere, which was the EU and with it the other countries.At this point is where we are at, no politician want's to explain to their countrymen that they have to pay for mistakes of other countries. This is why the debt hasn't been reduced. The only other option besides letting other contries pay for mistakes of Greece is that Greece needs to somehow salvage itself (with moderate help from the EU) and that means cutting their spending.Now, i fully agree that at this point in time, Greece will never get up on it's own (but Spain for instance did) and the only option is to do a haircut.But if you want to place blame on Germany for this, you also have to put way more blame on Greece on 2 fronts: For actually joining the Euro (without it, this wouldn't have happened) and that Greece didn't get it's finances in Order.On a sidenote, while in theory Germany on it's own could shoulder all of Greeces dept (if we ignore how unpopular/impossible it would be to tell that to the average German) , Germany is in the position that a bankruptcy of itself would completly destroy the EU. The other contries wouldn't be able to somehow save it. So huge chunks of additional debt can be very big issue in the long run.So in short, i feel with the Greece people on this, but this whole topic is just a giant clusterfuck of interdependant shit....[Edit:] Just thought about 1 more thing that i foregot, at every step Greece could have simply defaulted on the debt and it still can. It would not be as smooth (in the short term) as a voluntary haircut in unison with the other European Contries, but it would still be better than the current situation.",d5b1kmw,d5azf5f,4sms1q,0.999990292,0.999980584,Brexit,13-07-16

(Who would be so stupid to force a fine on a country that already isn't doing well?)As i said, if it were only the Greece debt, Germany could handle it fine. 70b more to a 2000b debt doesn't matter that much.The solution to the problems of Greece in that case then would be that all European Countries adopt the financial model of Greece and spend way more than the country earns.Which is in itself insane because it absoluted depends on infinite growth, and our planet only has limited resources.Now, we could create an artificial inflation of let's say 3% over the entire EURO zone by printing money. But unless Greece would be able to reduce it's spending to the same rate or lower, the problem would remain, it would only be delayed.That is indeed one possible part of the solution, but it only helps if first the current debt is somehow reduced.But as a added to my previous post: Greece has the option to default on it's debt and it also has the option to leave the Euro.Germany doesn't force Greece to take the current shitty deal, but Greece decided that the shitty deal is better than the other options.",d5b4imj,d5b2iui,4sms1q,0.999999279,0.999998559,Brexit,13-07-16
