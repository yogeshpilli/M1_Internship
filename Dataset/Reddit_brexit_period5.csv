While it is correct that it could allow MPs to block Brexit, it's not a breach of standard or a change in law.""The Government will implement what you decide"". That's the Government saying that though. You have 3 parts to our system. The Parliament, the Government, and the Judiciary. If the Government sends out leaflets saying ""We will build a wall around Birmingham"" that doesn't mean that they get to do that without Parliamentary consent, it's just their promise to you. It also appears that May and the Government are trying to keep their promise.Just because the Goverment says they will do something doesn't mean they can break the law to do it. Regardless of whether the UK population would like them to. The Government can't repeal laws without Parliamentary consent, and the Judiciary's job was to review law and history and decide on whether that was happening here.This was a judgment about the proper process, drawing on accumulated legal precedents all the way back to before the Civil War, and the famous Coke judgment of 1610 that ""the King by his proclamation or other ways cannot change any part of the common law or statute law"".That means that if invoking Article 50 irrevocably puts the UK on the path to changing the rights of its citizens, then that decision must be taken in Parliament.",dcz3lna,5qgtk6,5qgtk6,0.973073418,0.946146835,Brexit,27-01-17

14196,5,SamSchpasm,"Fair enough, my comment was ad-hom, but I listened to both parts of that podcast and there wasn't actually an argument there, so I don't have much else to go on...The reason I think dismissing Mark Collett out of hand is a defensible position in this instance is that his video is clearly masquerading as a pro-Brexit piece of rhetoric. Mark Collett doesn't support democracy, he's a fascist. He doesn't want to protect workers' rights, he wants to protect white rights. He's trying to garner support from the 52% who voted Leave, when only a tiny minority of that number would give him the time of day if they knew what he really thought.I don't know your opinion on this, but the fact that you've linked his video suggests a certain amount of sympathy with his cause. This damages political discourse immensely - it gives people on the left/Remain side of the argument additional ammunition to fire at their fellow citizens, and it undermines genuine arguments for Leave by conflating them with idiotic racism and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.There are plenty of commentators out there who support Brexit because they believe it is in the best interests of everyone in the UK.

Absolutely agree with you on bullish trends. All signs point to a further break to the downside if anything. Re inflation vs exports. I agree that the economy benefited from the devaluation. But I am staggered by how little. We are now firmly in the 'having cake and eating it' phase. We benefit from a weak currency whilst still having access to the Single Market.

We do have quite a big job market here, and in my opinion, it should be open to expertise from all over the world. That way the talent will be top class.It's true though, sadly, that the UK is like a trash heap compared to other countries, but this is a problem of scale. Take any country and increase it's population while constraining it's area and eventually the density will cause things to become brittle, societally speaking.Take for example the UKs population density of 261.66 people/kmÂ², this is just slightly higher than Germany's 226.87 people/kmÂ², but when you think about England, and exclude the rural parts of Scotland which average that out, England is actually over 400 people/kmÂ². That being said, the Netherlands has an equal population density to the UK, but has only 30% of the population. I think it's a mixture of total population versus population density.The thing is, it's not like we don't realise it.

Hear me out.I was born in South Africa, my mother is from England. After high school I decided to go to the UK because I was negative about the anti-white sentiment that has been building in South Africa since the 90s.I got a job in London as a Linux system administrator but to say I didn't like living in the UK would be an extreme understatement.I quit after 3 months and took a tour of continental Europe, and then Scandinavia, and long story short, I ended up moving to Sweden permanently.Comparing Sweden and the UK is quite difficult. Honestly, the UK is like a rubbish bin compared to Sweden. Things are cleaner, more organized, more efficient, there is more space, housing is a lot cheaper (at least outside of the major cities), and it's just far more pleasant.I didn't live in other EU countries obviously, but certainly Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Austria all looked similar to Sweden in a lot of respects.I'm just kind of mind boggled why there are EU citizens actually flocking to the UK ... it really isn't better than their own countries, and behind in a lot of respects.I'm not bashing the UK. I enjoyed Devon when I was a child, when we visited family there, and it was actually quite similar to South Africa. But it seems to have gone down a lot, and I'm not quite sure how it came to the point where too much immigration to the UK was a primary reason for voting Brexit.

14288,5,despairing_koala,"Also the UK social security/NHS system is funded very differently. In countries like Germany and the Netherlands there is a big emphasis on individual contribution. The UK pretty much allows full access for any UK citizen (which had to include EU citizens under the freedom of movement) to the full set of benefits, whereas Germany will only give you anything further than a very basic survival allowance if you have paid in previously. Working EU migrants are definitely paying in more than they get out. Poorly qualified long term unemployed Brits with seven kids on benefits who are unwilling to accept jobs outside of their neighbourhood - not so much.  If Britain changed their system to a more contribution oriented system funding would be less of a problem. This, however, may not be palatable to the native Brits still expecting a cradle to grave system.  It may come anyway, though, once the economy tanks post Brexit.Britain is also, I think, more willing to accept workers from abroad - acceptance of other EU qualification is much higher than in Germany where any ""different"" type of CV will very much exclude you from the labour market, I don't necessarily think that people were voting for less immigration. What they wanted was for immigration to stop negatively affecting their lives, for example through poor health care provisions, overcrowded schools etc. The problem is that all the problems which government conveniently blamed on immigration are actually a result of insufficient public spending, due to the fact that people contribute too little through tax, in particular the wealthier parts of society. My partner and I are on a combined salary of around Â£100K, and we would pay a lot more in tax in Germany or Holland.

Although initially sceptical as a Brexit voter as to the pace things were moving along and Theresa May's initial refusal to really say anything on the matter in the run up to her plan being announced, I genuinely feel like things are starting to fall into place for the better and I have been quite impressed with how May has been handling things and coming across over the past few weeks. I mean she is currently globetrotting and sealing new deals and at least being pro-active around the situation now. The whole Trump thing is a bit of a sore subject for many but that is a completely different matter entirely. I am even glad the High Court ruling went the way it did because this will now limit the excuses from those attempting to block Brexit when the inevitable vote to trigger article 50 comes around.

Or rather was until some laws were changed.The Polish make up the largest of the UK immigrant population segments.Any Western European country offers a much better standard of living than Poland. The difference between the UK and Sweden, or the UK and Germany, is much, much smaller than the difference between either of those and Poland, especially rural Poland. Rural Poland is like the UK second half of the 19th century, with a couple cars added. Poland, while having a much lower standard of living, has a decent education system. Many young Polish people are fluid in both English and German. Thus any countries that are speaking either English or German are high on their list.The official number of Polish immigrants in Germany is similar to that in the UK. But Germany also shares a border with Poland. There is a very large number of Polish people working in Germany temporarily who don't take permanent residence in Germany, and thus don't show up in those immigration numbers.

The latest suggestion is for the UK to pay up to 60 billion euros as part of a deal to leave the EU. So all those supposed savings we would get from leaving the EU have had a serious dent put into them.Let's look at the figures shall we.In 2015, the UK paid Â£13 billion to the EU budget, it should have been Â£18 billion but the rebate came to Â£5 billion. The current euroOnce article 50 is triggered, it starts a 2 year process of leaving the EU, that means that for the next 2 years we will be paying Â£13 billion to the EU budget (that's assuming we still get the rebate, if not then add Â£5 billion) so during the process of leaving we are still going to be paying at least Â£26 billion to the EU budget, then add the 60 billion euros (Â£52 billion) we are at the moment expected to pay (its safe to assume this figure will drop as the process go on) so in total, leaving the EU could end up costing us an estimated Â£78 billion and that's under the assumption we still get the Â£5 billion per year rebate, which let's be realistic will be the first thing the other EU members will try to get rid of.And you say we're winning.

Many people on the leave side talked about the fact that single market trade and open borders had to go hand in hand, and Cleggy never shut up about the fact that a brexit vote must mean leaving the single market. It was always bleedingly obvious that what they're now calling a ""hard"" brexit; that is, one that gives us control over immigration, would mean leaving the single market. The whole premise of the ""soft"" brexit came from those who wanted to see either continued open borders OR single market membership as far as I can see.For me, ""hard"" brexit seems to be the ""leaving the EU, leaving the single market, controlling our borders"" that was suggested in the referendum, at least as far as the rhetoric I heard, while ""soft"" brexit is a slightly more watered down version put forward by the type of people who were never campaigning to leave in the first place.

To paint the picture that 'no one voted for a hard brexit' when the subtype didn't exist before the vote, is very clever. So where did it come from? Labour, SNP, the media? Maybe the Tories themselves? Fact of the matter is: -  -  to be able to control the borders we have to renegotiate our access to the single market, as the current deal allows free movement of people -  to be able to get new trade deals with other countries we have to renegotiate the customs union, as currently we are prohibited from doing soNeither of these should be a surprise frankly.

14546,5,MASSIVEGLOCK,"Not all people working on zero hours contracts are students looking for part time work. Some are disadvantaged people with little to no education who have found themselves on the bottom rung of society and require job security to live. This is exactly the point about zero hours contracts and how they can provide instability to people's lives. Falsely inflating employment figures with zero hours contracts which erode employees rights under the guise of flexible working helps nobody and hides a problem. In fact, the bottom rungs of uk society are saturated with migrant workers. The drivers for this are high unemployment rates in Portugal, Cyprus,  Greece,  Italy,  Spain,  and a comparitively high minimum wage in the uk. This is partly why zero hours contracts have emerged, due to the oversupply of low skill workers and the ability for employers to pick and choose.All countries require skilled workers. Not all of these skills can be sourced from within one country/ workforce so immigration is a positive thing  if skills are advertised and sourced specifically. Just allowing the movement of people from countries with high unemployment to areas with a high minimum wage doesn't benefit either country; the country to which the migrants go suffers from a depressed minimum wage and widening gap between classeses; and the country from which the migrants come lose their workers, best and brightest, future entrepreneurs etc.",ddecjrn,dde681d,5owic8,0.999696523,0.999393045,Brexit,06-02-17

14562,5,kemb0,"To obtain a degree broadly implies you have the ability to think about things critically. Much of degree education revolves around this. If you're educated to this level you're likely to have a heightened sense of appreciating the broader picture. It's possible too that you'll have been exposed to a greater diversity of people from different backgrounds. If you only get educated to a basic level, the chances are you'll not leave your home town, your circle of friends and the bigoted views that come from being in a relatively isolated environment. In essence what you're saying is right but not that people who go to university are left leaning but that going to university educates you on a wider degree of aspects and factors of life that are more likely to make you sympathetic to the rest of the world and those around us -  ie left leaning. Growing up without an education doesn't expose you to that. It's not that only people who are nurtured to be left leaning are more likely to go to university. So in essence higher educated people vote remain due to1) a tought ability to comsider the bigger picture. 2) greater exposure to multiple nationalities and a globalised mindset and appreciation that foreigners' values are broadly the same as ours. 3) greater exposure to diverse opinions that lower educated people would tend not to get as they'd be more likely not to leave their home town and be restricted to its ""clan"" mentality and sense that outsiders are dangerous. This mentality is very well documented. I'd argue all these above essentially mean you're smarter than someone without a degree. If you have a better ability to interpret data, you're more likely to read up on the facts and interpret the truths from lies and you have a greater knowledge and experience of the world around you, that makes you smarter.

14565,5,S4mb741,"I think your completly missing the point of ZHC. They are not supposed to be positions that offer stability over the long term, they provide both the worker and the company with flexible hours when it suits both parties. If you increase minimum wage like we have or insist on minimum amounts of hours for these positions they will cease to exist. I worked as a cashier for a supermarket and in the 7 or 8 years since I left it's gone from 5 or 6 staff on the tills to 10 self service units with 1 staff member to oversee them.The problem is these simply aren't positions that will ever be capable of offering long term or stable employment and no regulations will change that. The state should provide ample long term benefits alongside lots of education opporunities to ensure these people can actually get the skills needed to earn a decent living in the long term.You seem to be refering to a schrodingers migrant here one that is simultaneously moving here for the good minimum wage whilst simultaneously being the best and brightest and a future entrepreneur. Don't you think you are using the negatives of both scenarios to justify your position here?What you are suggesting is a command economy for labour. This itself has a ton of flaws over letting market forces do the work. Plus do you really think that anyone is going to be able to predict with any accuracy what skills we will need in the economy before we need them, in a way that won't be open to corruption, political influences, and industry protecionism? How would we strike a balance in this system between industries wanting more labour and workers wanting to remain on a higher wage? How easily could that be made into a political position like it already is with low skilled positions now. What you think is happening and what's actually happening are very different things. Migrants aren't coming here for the minimum wage, the uk has the lowest in western Europe in purchasing power and is behind both France and the Netherlands in real terms.  What's actually happening is people from places with high levels of unemployment are migrating to places with low levels of unemployment. This benefits both countries as one will lose a dependant on state aid the other will gain a contributer to state finances.

14578,5,British_guy83,"I'm going to contradict what you said for the sake of debate. (Please don't take it personally).Having a degree exposes someone to an instition which directly benefits from EU funding. There will also be students there that have also benefitted directly from EU funded programs. I wouldn't argue that it's because someone is 'smarter' so much as they are probably more 'conscious' and aware of how they and their friends have benefitted from EU funding. Universities tout those EU links as it helps promote their image to prospective students. It's self interest on their part and also to those who are exposed or have benefitted from the EU to vote remain.I would argue that jimjimmany is right. If you as a student or your international friends have benefitted from EU funding, as part of an exclusive club (students in this instance) you will be predisposed to believe the EU is a positive force and want that to remain. If you or your friends haven't benefitted from that club, or you have been penalised because of it (job loss, lack of opportunities, discrimination) you're more likely to be predisposed against it. You want to leave that situation.If you are poor and without qualifications, this doesn't necessarily mean that you aren't exposed to different cultures, faiths and ideas. Many inner city areas are diverse and they also have working class people who don't have qualifications. These people do mix. They aren't segregated. I could also argue that they're not necessarily confined to staying in their home town (the travelling community as an example) and that a lack of education doesn't equate to a lack of sympathy for others as you have inferred.1) **a taught ability**(by an EU funded institution) to consider the bigger picture. - it could be argued that you have been indoctrinated and brainwashed to conform to a standard that has been deemed 'an acceptable way of thinking.' And To deviate from that standard is to be looked down upon.2) I disagree, for the reasons outlined above. Contact and exposure is the key in my view here, regardless of education.3) i'd like a source please. I have seen that there was [a study in america](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2007/08/05/world/americas/05iht-diversity.1.6986248.html) where the opposite phenomenon seems to have occurred. Although it was about diversity and not necessarily about debate. I could, though, argue though that a Friday night out in any pub in Britain will give you a range of diverse opinions. Regardless of educational level. Although how 'intelligent' they are; is debatable.Intelligence is subjective and contextual. What you believe to be intelligent may not be intelligent to others. Contextual; Put a fully mobile Stephen hawking and a 6 year old native child on a desert island. That child will know how to live and hunt and survive. In that context, even though we consider Stephen Hawkings to be a genuis, the child can be considered the more intelligent of the two.Taking an elitist mentality may make you feel superior to leave voters; but it won't help change anything. In my view a more community-minded mentality would be beneficial to everyone.",ddf5tmn,ddew62m,5se4w5,2.17E-09,-0.999999996,Against,07-02-17

14632,5,British_guy83,"The EU may have funded non-academic projects but the questions are 'what impact did that have on those without qualifications?' And 'was that EU funding off-set by the austerity cuts made by the government?'. If this information was known before the referendum and was explained to the masses, the Referendum result may or may not have been different. I will reiterate that the lack of answers to those questions pre-referendum was taken as a sign of how little we cared for their point of view. There has been data published before that showed a strong correlation between areas that voted to leave and lower government spending per head. In the eyes of the working classes it would be to their benefit if the government focuses less on giving money to the EU and instead turned its attention inward and invested money to the rest of Britain. This might not necessarily be a silly decision on their part. Another point that I've heard little mention of from academics is that, Although the leave vote wasn't overwhelming, much can be said for collective intelligence. Take the [UNU A.I project](http://m.marketwired.com/press-release/swarm-ai-correctly-predicts-kentucky-derby-accurately-picking-all-four-horses-2122877.htmas) as an example. Maybe individually we are wrong in our choices and reasons in how we voted but correct collectively as a nation. It's an interesting thought and I would welcome any views in the idea.As for students and academics; they are taught to be articulate and to be able to express themselves clearly and concisely. It's a luxury not afforded to the non-educated and I think we should forgive them for not being able to express themselves in an academic fashion. I believe if you cut through to the heart of what their issue is and not necessarily pay attention to the way they express it; you will see their actual issues.

A return to a communal mentality where we all care for each other. The vast majority of the working classes (bar the few) aren't racist and will tell you so themselves.I wouldnt say students are gullible but Students are made impressionable by the very nature of their environment. Students and academics also are not necessarily free to think in directions and ways that they would like to...unlike the working classes. Want a degree? Write an acceptable dissertation that we can publish and you will pass! I have known someone from a very strong working class background that had wanted to write dissertations on a controversial subject and was explicitly told that they would not obtain a degree if they wrote them. (wanted to write her dissertation on false memory rape victims). Universities are also unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them and if that funding comes from the EU, they're unlikely to criticisize and more likely to promote it.

In fact, my daily life has been completely unaffected by the vote to leave so far.Bat's view is completely skewed though. Yes, people who are pro-Brexit have been labelled as ignorant, racist, and inferior by a minority of Remainers, but equally, anybody who voted Remain has been labelled as unpatriotic, privileged, and arrogant by the Brexit media. Bat uses the phrase ""working people"" as though anybody who voted Remain is either a student, or so wealthy that they don't have to work. This is garbage. A completely false picture has been painted that somehow the middle classes, who largely voted Remain, live this luxurious, hedonistic life, while the working classes have been reviled and oppressed. It's fantasy.Young people at university haven't been indoctrinated at all, and the idea that they live in a bubble is equally wrong. I work at a university and I can tell you that young people get exposed to a huge range of views here - far more than young people who don't have the opportunity to go to university, who often end up living, working, and growing old in the same community they were born in. Around 60% of students have to work part-time jobs to support their studies. They've had to work very hard at school, far harder than previous generations had to work, so to say they don't know anything about hard work and real life is just plain wrong.â€œUni Bubbleâ€ and â€œcotton woolâ€ are the sorts of phrases thrown around by the right-wing media to try to discredit educated people. Itâ€™s the whole â€œweâ€™ve had enough of expertsâ€ all over again, and itâ€™s dangerous.The way that young people have been completely thrown aside in this debate is shocking, and we as a society will pay for it sooner or later. Our economy is driven by university graduates. The service economy, which is completely reliant on graduates and high-skilled immigrants, accounts for 80% of the UK economy. The right-wing media, and this current government, seem set on doing everything they can to antagonise those people upon which the UK economy is completely reliant, and are already laying the groundwork to scapegoat these people if it all goes tits up.Theresa May has done a shambolic job as leader until the last couple of weeks, when it seems like she has bitten the bullet and abandoned the idea of uniting the country, and is pandering only to the 27% of the UK population that voted to Leave. People voted in the referendum based on a feeling - on whether they felt, on June 23rd 2016, whether under the status quo their lives were going to get better, or worse. It really is as simple as that.

14658,5,SamSchpasm,"In lieu of an answer from kemb0, I'll take up the mantle. Firstly, I don't agree with the implications of what kemb0 is saying - I don't think people voted for Brexit because they're stupid. I think the link between these statistics and the vote is that if you are a victim of the education system (that is to say, you didn't achieve anything higher than GCSEs - perhaps victim is a bit strong), you are less likely to be in a higher paid job, and therefore less happy with the status quo, and with less hope for the future.However, the link between EU membership and the hardships facing ""left behind Britain"" is extremely tenuous, and this is what Remain voters are finding difficult to digest. I completely agree with a lot that Leave voters are complaining about, and would throw all my support behind many of their demands, but our EU membership has NOTHING to do with the vast majority of them. Hospital waiting times, austerity, school places, wage stagnation. There is no plausible link between these issues and EU immigration. It has been conjured by two parties - those who need a scapegoat for their near decade of anti-poor policies (the Tory Brexiteers), and the idealists, who don't like foreigners, and hate the fact that modern global politics has pushed them to the fringe (UKIP Brexiteers).Anybody who says they vote on facts and logic alone is lying. We all vote emotively to some degree. The problem with Leave is that these strong emotions have been manipulated, and directed at a straw man. What should have been a great victory for the most vulnerable in our society has been twisted, and used by the most cynical politicians and media in the land as a way of dividing the country on a phantom argument, while they profit as much as they can from the in-fighting.",ddkmtqd,ddiz1da,5se4w5,0.002211808,-0.995576383,Against,10-02-17
14659,5,PourScorn,"Thanks for your contribution. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with your comments regarding the effects of migration. In 1997 UK net migration was approximately 50,000. Net migration rose to 185,000 in 2003. Then after the Treaty of Accession allowing 10 more countries to join the EU it's gone totally out of control, only dipping below 200,000 one year between 2003 and 2016. I absolutely agree that government has to also take responsibility here however, as part of that figure is as a result of people from other parts of the world coming to the UK. I would argue it is a combination of both free movement (very limited UK control) and failure of government (benefits being too appealing, lack of training resulting in skills shortages, seeing migration as an easy fix).Kemb0 did actually reply to me in a similar thread, click on my name and see my latest comments if you want to see their follow up.

14663,5,SamSchpasm,"It's true that migration has shot up over the past 20 years, but understanding why, and what that means for the UK, is the key. Why should it be considered inherently bad? Those numbers are pretty abstract - when spread across the country, what does it actually mean? The numbers are determined by the demands of the economy, not the other way around.My main point is that EU migration has had little or nothing to do with the issues that are being pinned to it, and the hardships facing people. It's a very convenient narrative, but it's scapegoating. We know that EU migrants offer a net contribution to both the NHS and to education, and make a huge contribution to our economy. We know that EU migrants can be sent home if they're not working. We know that a large proportion of the EU immigration figures comprise students, who either go home after their studies, or get high-skilled jobs and end up paying higher taxes afterwards.There are serious problems in the UK, particularly for the poorer northern towns who have been abandoned by Westminster. EU immigration isn't to blame. If anything, it helps soften the blows being landed by government policy. EU regulations aren't to blame either - the idea that EU red tape has prevented British parliament from enacting laws that help the working poor is laughable - EU legislation has done far more good than harm to workers in the UK. The sovereignty argument is hollow - we've simply had decades of politicians not lifting a finger to help the poor, now blaming their inaction on faceless foreigners who aren't given the chance to defend themselves. Why has nobody found it strange that not a single representative of the EU was invited to get involved in the pre-referendum debate? It's because they would tell you the truth about what the EU is, and what it does, and neither campaign wanted you to know that.The people who are really to blame for our problems have successfully managed to turn two halves of the country against each other. It's a distraction, and it has worked. Five years from now, the false promises of Brexit will all be blamed by one side on the Remain voters who opposed it all along, and by the other side on gullible voters.

However, that would likely presuppose that independence could be wrapped up and sorted within the Brexit timescale; if the date of independence was married to the UK's date for leaving the EU, one could imagine a relatively stable transition - indeed, many of London's financial services might see relocating to Glasgow / Edinburgh as an option, and result in a rosy future for Scotland.If, as is more likely, Scottish independence was a messy divorce (as is Brexit likely to be), there's probably years of protracted negotiations, and no nice synchronisation of timelines, with awkward periods of UK leaves EU, turmoil, Scotland leaves UK, more turmoil, Scotland crawls back into EU in about a decade or two as a small fry after all the juicy financial services have bitten the bullet and moved to Paris.(this comment lifted verbatim from my friend on FB, but I completely agree)",ddl474n,5t8nd5,5t8nd5,0.002123431,-0.995753138,Against,10-02-17

I believe that migration has been exploited by business as an easy fix - as you say, there is a demand in the economy which is being filled, but this is causing serious issues to the UK's public services and native population who are struggling to get affordable housing (renting or buying) and jobs.I would somewhat dispute ""a large proportion"" of the EU immigration figures being students. It's around 25%. It is quite big, just a semantics issue on that one. 41% of the non-EU immigration numbers are students.I have no problem in saying that immigration is a good thing for the UK, but in my view it needs to be limited quite extensively from its current figures. You can't expect reasonable assimilation, migrants learning English and there to be no issues arising when the numbers aren't being phased in. Yes migrants contribute culturally to the UK. Yes they contribute economically. But it can't be done unrestrained in my view.

14688,5,SamSchpasm,"I think we agree on a lot, but the point I'm trying to make is that I really don't think these problems have been caused by EU migration - they've been caused by our own government. Because of the ineptness of our own policies, EU immigration is perhaps compounding these issues in some areas, and cynical politicians have jumped on that, and swelled it up to be this great, hulking beast.300,000 is only too much when you don't have enough houses to cater to that demand. It's only too much if you don't properly fund your NHS and school system. Eastern European immigrants coming to the UK and taking low-paid jobs is a problem because our school system has failed too many people. We have far too many people competing with Polish and non-EU immigrants for low-paid, backbreaking work. We have the resources to produce far more high-skilled UK nationals, and in the South-East it has worked pretty well. Better funded schools and higher wages for teachers means more kids going to university, and more graduates going into high-skilled high-pay jobs, and EU migration picks up the slack at the bottom of the economy. The problem is that this model hasn't been rolled out elsewhere. Our economy is 80% Service now, but only 40% of UK nationals are getting the qualifications usually required to work in the sector.Leaving the EU will perhaps stop the pain on some of these issues, for a while, but it's just a sticking plaster. We haven't seen a single policy come from the new government that seeks to address the root causes of these issues. They're happy to pile the blame on the EU. The issues you raise on assimilation and language are far more prevalent in non-EU migrant communities, who the government already had the ability to vet and control (but made absolutely no effort to do so). That alone should show us that the Conservatives are playing a confidence trick. They do not want to curb immigration, and we'll see that over the next few years - it's clear that immigration quotas will form a key part of our trade negotiations with the wider world.As a country, we've decided that the best way to relieve pressure on social services and infrastructure is to sabotage the economy, rather than fund them adequately in the first place. Long term, it isn't going to solve anything. The economy will very likely weaken as a result, certainly in the short to medium term, meaning even less investment in the areas that really need it. We've empowered the most cynical, dishonest politicians we have. We've betrayed our most important allies and friends. We've removed important legislation and regulations that protect our rights, the quality of our goods, and our environment. We've irreversibly disillusioned our youth. Most importantly, we've turned the working and middle classes against each other, at a time when it is of utmost importance that they stand together.",ddlvh4f,ddlevgd,5se4w5,0.018243493,-0.963513014,Against,11-02-17

Your posts seem quite defeatist in the sense that this is a bad thing, that we've betrayed others and ""irreversibly disillusioned our youth"". I see the division of the country as kind of a good thing really - it prompts us to engage in debate and re-evaluate our expectations again. For example, to go back to the immigration issue, I really do think that it was a topic that for many years people felt was too sensitive to discuss and to express opinions on. But now that there is division we are seeing government re-assess issues like free movement I think it's healthy that we confront these emotive subjects and devise strategies for balancing public opinion.",ddlz609,ddlvh4f,5se4w5,0.004604157,-0.990791686,Against,11-02-17
14690,5,SamSchpasm,"I think I am behind Brexit to some extent now  - I don't feel I have much of a choice. Despite what the Daily Mail would have you believe, I love my country, and my hand has been forced - standing up for what I believe will only cause more harm. I'm not like this in my offline life now, r/brexit is just an important part of my therapy, where I can rant and vent a little. It has also given me a much better idea of why so many people voted Leave. I was very much an ""oh my god the stupid old racists have ruined the country"" person in the immediate aftermath of the referendum.I think a lot of the doom-mongering coming from the Remain campaign has been dispelled, and I'm glad about that. The Remain politicians were just as bad - just because I wanted to stay in the EU doesn't mean I support the politics of Cameron's Tory government. Both sides did their utmost to manipulate the public, and in my opinion they were both ""Project Fear"". I'm ideologically pro-EU, I'll admit. I was always going to oppose it, but Brexit is not inherently a mistake - I believe there is a version of this that could still turn out positively for the UK, but the people we've got directing things do not fill me with confidence. The nature of the discourse hasn't changed since the referendum either, and the government has only encouraged this conflict - they've done nothing to actually try to heal the wounds inflicted by the referendum.I absolutely want the period of sensible, reflective debate that you describe, and sharing ideas with somebody like you gives me hope, but I think we're going in the opposite direction as a nation. Both sides of the debate are represented by their most extreme, shrill proponents. Anti-intellectualism is rife - experts, students, and centrist politicians are being denigrated at every opportunity. The extreme ends of the media have gone completely insane, and I feel like were on the cusp of a new age of political tribalism, where our parties and our media tell us what we believe, and if we don't conform, we're exiled.",ddm1z27,ddlz609,5se4w5,0.06337822,-0.87324356,Against,11-02-17

There are ""coded"" or ""veiled"" ways of expressing racism today, as racists themselves are not as stupid as everybody thinks. They are well aware that their views are wrong, so they do not publicly state them in a very open and clear way.So things like ""shut the borders"", ""get control"" somehow imply that the Uk government doesn't have ""control"" and it's borders are just open for everyone to come in, which is not the case. So it is not a stretch to say people screaming SHUT THE BORDER could have racist or xenophobic motivations. Not saying all of them, but certainly many, not a tiny fraction. Other popular expressions are ""taking back our country"", ""making our country great again"". Again implying the UK was great at a prior point and it is no longer ( for some reason ). These are used in right ring circles around the globe, not just limited to the UK.I would agree, but I think he panders to racists/xenophobes. Absolutely. This is a major contradiction here.

14770,5,Dr_Richard_Kimble1,"Ok, first of all, you are the one that initiated speculation with this comment with no evidenceBut, just for the sake of discussion. Both Spain and Portugal have enjoyed considerably better standards of living since the adaptation of the Euro. This is fact and I don't think you would dispute it. Also, I think you need to take into account the financial crisis during 2007-8 and how much money was literally wiped out. Would you blame that on the Euro as well? If anything the US was the most devastated during that crisis, but it's ramifications spread around the world.Yes, shared fiscal policy. Absolutely, it is possible, but it is a slow and steady process. I liken it to a marathon. If you sprint in the beginning you will tire out quickly and lose the race. A slow and steady pace of European integration is required. We must not move too quickly, but we should absolutely not move backwards, which is unfortunately what happened with Brexit. I completely understand your concerns regarding in culture. If you would just bear with me for a moment. You mention culture. Let's take the United Kingdom as an example. As far as I understand, Scotland, Wales, England, Northern Ireland all have different cultures and are actually separate nations to a degree. Yet they all cooperate in the area of currency and even political governance, why is that? Could it be because they have decided that it is better to have a fully integrated system, instead of 4 separate currencies? Hence â€¦ the UNITED Kingdom.Now, you might take this example and say, the UK has a shared common language. Absolutely true. But are you really going to tell me that language is an impossible barrier to overcome for a monetary union? Let's take the issue of the very concept of a nation. Within nations we have different cultures do we not? I am sitting in the US, and you wouldn't believe how different each of the 50 states are, and if you compare the South the the Coasts they can be like different countries. Yet, we created a union successfully. So if we can overcome cultural differences within our nations, there is nothing to say we cannot overcome them with other nations. It is always possible to create a union, it is just a better of how fast, and how much will you have to overcome barriers. Also, European nations do have very similar culture, heritage, history so it is very doable. Also, it has literally been functioning before our very eyes for decades now so we know it's possible. Are there problems? Of course. Do you really think without the Euro we would not have problems?I personally believe Europe divided would be the death of Europe. These small European nations have no chance of projecting financier, legal, military, moral influence if they are not under an umbrella body. States like the UK, France, Italy would be easily dominated and exploited in the global arena by USA, China, Russia, Brazil, India, etc. I truly believe in Winston Churchill's vision for Europe.""Hard as it is to say now.. I look forward to a United States of Europe, in which the barriers between the nations will be greatly minimised and unrestricted travel will be possible."" - Winston ChurchillAnd another one from Churchill""We cannot aim at anything less than the Union of Europe as a whole, and we look forward with confidence to the day when that Union will be achieved.

For example, a person may be unemployed in Spain, but  virtually everybody has access to education. This is unheard of in the US. So yes, while the unemployment level is high in those countries (primarily among the youth) the system itself is producing a high standard of living. Also, when compared unemployment rates in 2017 to for example 1980, please consider the fact that every year that goes by now, very large advances take place in automation, tech, etc. This also is attributing to the current phenomenon we are seeing. There is nothing indicating that there would be lower unemployment in Spain without the Euro. People like the blame the single currency because it is a popular target. The Euro was implemented ok, but there were a few mistakes. I believe Greece adopted the Euro too soon ( by the way, all these countries did this of their own choice, no one forced them ), but by and large the Euro has been very successful. There are increased strains on Europe as a whole at the moment and the enemies of Europe abroad would like nothing more then to see the EU disintegrate and the Euro disappear.

14818,5,perpetual_C000009A,"I think ""past the point of birth"" is a little inaccurate in some situations.  If Mr and Mrs Smith from Tunbridge Wells decide to adopt an orphaned Syrian toddler, that child will have changed tribes, after the point of birth.  However, if that same child grows up in Syria and then migrates to the UK when it is 18, it will have been brought up with Syrian values and customs. It can be difficult for somebody to just throw away everything they've been taught through childhood and their formative years, in order to ""fit in"" with a new tribe.  And so we got multiculturalism. We all respect that other people have different ways of living their lives, and we accept and tolerate it. Therefore I don't care if my neighbour eschews pork, or my colleague insists on wearing some religious headwear, and they don't care that I like my beer and am prone to dropping the occasional F word here and there.  So far, so good. But then we get a problem when some other culture has values so different to our own, and which we find to be either distasteful or downright harmful. Telling women what they are allowed to wear, or mutilating them, for example.  Now we have a problem, and we no longer like this other tribe, except a few ""their culture of eating babies is just as valid as our own..."" voices. Didn't you know they eat babies? It was on the front page of The Mail, probably.  And we get a backlash against everything related to the pariah tribe. Maybe only a handful of them adopt the values that are entirely incompatible with our way of life, but now they're ALL a problem and need to be dealt with. And that gets extended to include all of their culture and all of their people, even those who were born yesterday. And no, you can't swap tribes because it would break your parents' hearts and you'll lose all of your friends; and nobody in the new tribe will like you anyway, because you've already been tainted by the touch of your old tribe. Sure, some people will accept you, but to the average person on the street, your accent, mannerisms and maybe your physical appearance will be screaming out that you don't belong here.  So, in spite of your best efforts, with even the strongest will in the world, changing tribes largely takes effort from both the individual and the tribe, in order to be workable. And no tribe can guarantee the acceptance of all of its members.",ddqjzms,5u0t99,5u0t99,0.999997708,0.999995417,Brexit,14-02-17

I can sugar coat it with a ""oh, it's just his culture and I've no reason to look down upon it"", but ultimately, I am expressing a view that my culture is superior to his, by the simple acts of drinking a beer on a Sunday and not cracking my daughter's skull open with a cricket bat.  It is entirely subjective, but when looking at cultural differences, there's really no objective stance to take. I'd suggest a confucian ""as long as it doesn't harm others"" test, but even that is subjective. Some cultures do not care about certain harms to certain sections of the population. I cannot consider a culture to be anything but inferior if its practices include willful harm to its adherents or outsiders.

What if people don't want to be part of a tribe, because they don't want to be slaves of the state? What place do those people have in society?

Over a quarter of tax is paid by fewer than 300,000 people, and the rest of the bill is largely picked up by people earning Â£30k a year, or more.What has changed since the recession is that it used to be a good deal for the middle classes. You get a good education, you get a good job, you buy a nice house, and you can afford to make a significant tax contribution. Since the recession, the deal has gone rotten. A good education gets you a mediocre job, a small flat (or house share) that costs half of your income, and even more taxes (especially if you throw in a Â£30k student loan repayment).This I believe is a major source of Remain voter bitterness. The media has painted middle class existence as one of comfort, stability, security - a complete myth - and the government consistently fucks this demographic with their policies, chasing upper class financial support and working class votes. The opportunities of Brexit are for the richest, and have been sold to the poorest - fuck the people in the middle, as always.",ddrm0ij,ddqn294,5u0t99,0.998143148,0.996286295,Brexit,15-02-17

If you were creating a society from scratch, you probably wouldn't bother with alcohol, would you? There are plenty of societies out there who don't allow alcohol, and they might consider that part of British society to be wholly undesirable.Now, you could probably make an argument for alcohol (and I'd argue that that would be British bias...), but try the argument with smoking. If you're still struggling, try it with online gambling, attitudes towards the elderly, or any other part of British culture that perhaps isn't optimal.Clearly we aren't capable of objectively arbitrating on this. Surely a wide umbrella of ""live and let live"" and ""the golden rule"" is the only alternative to forcing people to conform to a single culture and set of social norms, which sounds like fascism to me...",ddrmc2h,ddqwwlu,5u0t99,0.596686597,0.193373194,Neutral,15-02-17

15049,5,smidsmi,"See, this is one of the things that bugs me. People think that everyone who voted leave only did so because of the campaign, the 350m figure, or because someone told them to.I've tried having discussions with people who voted remain about this, but nobody really gets it. It's so frustrating, I don't know if it's because people truly don't understand, or because they don't want to, but it's infuriating.It boils down to one very simple fact. Globalisation affects metropolitan areas positively and rural &amp; suburban areas negatively. This cumulative effect has built up over time until eventually it has reached critical mass. The result is an uprising of these outsiders, the effect of which is a shakeup of the standard political order.And the key is this: it's no longer about trying to do what is right, it's about stopping doing what is wrong.The way that things have been going has not been working for everyone. In the same way that communism failed because it was flawed, even though the idea of it is noble, so too is globalisation failing, not because it is a bad idea, but because applying the idea has some fatal flaws.It's okay though to refute this. We're in the thick of it right now, we're all emotionally involved. But in a few decades from now, we'll be able to discuss things properly, and it will be irrefutable that the catalyst for the current uproar is ""the forgotten people"".Anyway, to respond to your points, I don't believe that reversing the decision will help us with the situation we have. We have a large group of people who are disillusioned and upset, who are at the window looking in, so to speak, and to reverse the decision would be to simply go back to that situation.It's abhorrent that there racial and cultural abuse, mostly because they tend to be focused on single mothers from other nations, who are unable to defend themselves and feel threatened. It saddens me that this happens, but it is not unique to the UK nor to this situation.I'm not sure why Wales, Scotland, and NI keep getting brought into this as though they are separate. They are part of the United Kingdom along with England. They are free to hold referendums and self-determine their own destiny if they so wish, alas, they have not. All four nations are part of the UK and should realise that.I am ashamed. I'm ashamed that I live in a world that turns a blind eye to it's problems rather than try and deal with them. I'm ashamed that we have areas like Soho and Stoke-on-Trent in the same country. I'm ashamed that people are rushing to defend bankers and their livelihoods, and care nothing for the people of old industrial cities, who now live on benefits or minimum wage jobs.I am ashamed. I'm ashamed to be one of the people who lives well, eats well, has a lot of disposable income, and lives in a nice area. But I voted leave. I grew up in an area that has no jobs now. I grew up with people who are considered not-important. I live and work with people who sneer at them, who think of them as lesser people. I am ashamed. But I'm also pleased. I'm pleased because this is just deserts. I'm pleased because this will now make people look in the mirror and ask, what have we become?I hope that a better, more honest future will arise from it.Sadly, I don't think it will.

15078,5,kitthecar,"Great reply thank you.I do however disagree with the corporation tax statement.Encourage business to stay or base themselves in the UK - mainly IT, tech, new start ups with easy finance low tax and great business rates*  â€˜Beggar my neighbourâ€™ is a term used to describe an economic policy, where you seek to gain an economic advantage by making other countries lose out. Cutting corporation tax is an effort to take away investment from countries with higher corporation tax. It creates an incentive for countries to keep cutting to see who has the lowest tax rate.For example, in a depression, a country may seek to devalue their currency to increase exports and domestic demand. However, if one country artificially keeps a currency undervalued â€“ it means other countries suffer from being relatively over-valued and lower domestic demand. It was a charge often leveled at China â€“ claiming currency manipulation gave Chinese exports a benefit over other countries. (its already happening with the Â£) Compensate firms for loss of Single Market by offering lower tax rates. The UK canâ€™t afford to see a big exodus of global multinationals. A cut in corporation tax could be the incentive they need to stay in. But, there are drawbacks to this policy.On Interest rates ....politicians pay lip service to hard work, saving, investing and so on, they create cheap credit and excess debt. Why bother saving when the Bank of Englandâ€™s base rate is just 0.5 per cent? NatWest is now contemplating a negative rate of interest. Yet politicians pretend to back those who save â€“ e.g. Osborneâ€™s paltry pensioner bonds. And people wonder why â€˜post-truth politicsâ€™ and radical frustration is sweeping the West.The only way the ongoing government deficit can be maintained under existing policies is consistently low interest rates. When politicians or others call for more government spending, they are calling for low interest rates and hurting savers. In addition, they are also raising the price of homes and denying a younger generation a chance to own their own home.South Africa has millions of skilled builders who are on Â£10-20 per day, they are honest hard working and happy people due to criminal gangs running the country, most unfortunately are out of work.The UK needs 200,000 new homes a year to cope with current demand ?

Last year it issued 2,349 such copies, and 1,835 the previous year. These are just some of those leaving to work abroad; non-EU states do not require the certificate.At the same time, doctors and nurses are joining the ranks of the unemployed, with a sharp increase in joblessness among medics in the first half of this year, taking the number to 13,400, up from 6,400 in late 2010. Sotoca and LÃ³pez, currently enjoying a brief holiday before beginning a full-time, three month course in Swedish paid for by the hospital, along with a 700-euro monthly grant, were not unemployed when they found work in Sweden. Sotoca has spent the last three years working in provincial hospitals on renewable short-term contracts; his wife was standing in for medics on sick or maternity leave.Many younger medics just finishing their in-hospital training face an even bleaker future, and more and more will likely follow in Sotoca and LÃ³pez's footsteps. ""Residents who finished in May are now finding that the only opportunities for them are working night shifts and weekends, or joining the ranks of the unemployed,"" says TomÃ¡s Toranzo of CESM, the national confederation of medical unions.It's tragic we are losing people when staffing levels in Spain are minimal""",de5if1u,de42k3p,5vp4wn,0.15306661,-0.69386678,Against,24-02-17

15095,5,smidsmi,"The 350m figure annoys people like myself. I feel it does damage to honest Eurosceptics. It's true that we would save roughly that amount in contributions, but it does not account for budget contention, economic downturn...or up turn, or for a reduction in funding requirement the NHS may have if it has less people to care for. I believe we have too much waste in the NHS, and too little preventative measures, but that is a discussion for another day, I'm sure you'll agree.Sure, there was an increase in this, and deplorable though it is, assigning the blame of it to everyone is unfair and unjust. There is an association between the ideology of religious fundamentalism and terrorism, particularly Islamic fundamentalism, and there is an association between immigration and Islam, which is how you get the immigration -It is unfair of us to say all Muslims are terrorists, just like saying all white men are racist, but it is also naive of us to say no Muslims are terrorists, just like it would be naive to say no white men are racist.Sadly, I don't have a solution for this situation, greater people than I have tried to solve this issue and failed, such is the problem with insurgencies. Perhaps the US should never have sowed those seeds, but what has happened has happened and here we are today.Then perhaps they should open the discussion again. The option would be: 1) remain in the UK and leave the EU, or 2) part company with the UK and apply for membership to the EU. If Scotland decided to do 2 then I would respect that, but I don't think they truly understand what a contentious issue it would be. Their finances are below the acceptable threshold, their main export partner would be outside the EU, and they would face severe opposition from Spain wanting to prevent Catalan following suit.I have to disagree with you here, my friend. It can be stopped, and if enough people want to, it will be stopped. This absolutist view has reduced my opinion of you. You should know better.I grew up in a council house with nothing, yet I am now within the top few percentile points of earners in the UK, living among people who have known nothing but this life. They grow up in nice houses, their parents have respectable professions, they of course don't accrue that heavy student loan, they go to good schools, their education starts early in life, and they continue on through university after university, picking up qualifications and certifications. They live their entire lives in this privileged world. Most of them don't know what it's like to be on the other side, to worry about money, to worry about food. Life within this bubble is very nice. If it wasn't, I wouldn't have worked so hard to get here. The status quo provides very well for them.But this isn't everything. I don't think it's a case of voting to keep what they have, but a lack of desperation to get what they don't. For people living on the edge, they have nothing to lose. An unemployed person can't lose their job. A poor person can't lose their investments. For the average poor Brit, they have nothing to gamble, and the way things have been going hasn't worked very well for them, so they've decided they want change, after all, they have nothing to lose.On the other hand, you have the opposites, who work in the City or for it, who have everything they need and live well, but they do have something to lose. Nationwide equality would mean a drastic reduction in their quality of living. Why would they vote for this?You don't sound very much like a doctor. Perhaps I should stop taking usernames seriously. If we didn't live in a globalised society, perhaps industrial cities would still be industrial cities, and not shells of industrial cities.Lots of people like to argue that the EU and globalisation is not to blame and didn't cause these issues. My point is that they aren't helping the issues either. In fact, they do nothing to address them.I would have voted remain and supported the EU had there been at least some effort to support SMEs and local business to provide uniform local jobs for the country. Instead, money is spent on failing institutions and tax breaks for multinationals.Finally, please, step down from your high ground, my friend. This world is changing because of people who refuse to step down, who believe themselves far superior to their fellow man.This is a time to realise we're all human, and that we have to work together.We're all equals, regardless of where we are born, or to whom we are born.Until this is realised on both sides, the unrest will continue.",de5qz7c,de5cex6,5vp4wn,0.999986192,0.999972385,Brexit,24-02-17

15118,5,Sirnails,"If the UK remains tied to the EU single market regulatory regime it will continue to pull our political and economic focus towards the worldâ€™s least successful economic zone while tying us down with needless and expensive regulation for all businesses, even if they do not export [source ](http://globalbritain.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Soft-Copy-Why-the-Single-Market-is-failing-Britain-Low-Res.pdf)â€¢ Trade is critical to the UK economy with UK exports of Â£669bn in 2015.â€¢ The UK has the largest current account deficit in the G7 approaching 6% of GDP.Understanding the reasons for this are critical to designing the right trade strategy post BREXIT. It is clear from the UKâ€™s performance from within the single market that something is badly amiss.â€¢ Asymmetry One â€“ the UK runs a substantial global surplus in services and a substantial deficit in goods. The UKâ€™s goods trade deficit with the EU was Â£89bn in 2015. The UK recorded a Â£10bn goods surplus with the Americaâ€™s (largely USA). Odd that the UK should be in surplus with the US, where there is no preferential trade deal, and a massive deficit within the Single Market. Further, the UK service surplus with the US is approximately 50% higher than all 27 nations of the EU combined.â€¢ Asymmetry Two â€“ the UK runs a trade surplus with the rest of the world and a very large deficit with the EU. This is a paradox â€“ the UK experiencing underperformance to the regulatory regime it is tied into, but out-performance where it is not.â€¢ Asymmetry Three â€“ the EU is a declining bloc. Its GDP growth has lagged every other region in the world for a generation. The rate of decline is accelerating. This has caused business to vote with its feet away from the declining EU to faster growth markets. In 1999 61% of UK trade was with the EU, now it is 43%. By 2025 we estimate the EU will account for under 35% trade.â€¢ We believe structurally low EU economic growth and the nature of its Single Market, which favours trade in goods over the UKâ€™s strategic advantage in services, has caused the UKâ€™s exports with the EU to perform so poorly and so much better with the rest of the world. These are critical observations and greatly undermine the case for remaining in the Single Market or EEA.â€¢ Global tariffs continue to fall. Average tariffs into the EU are now just above 1%. While they remain high in a few sectors, agricultural products being the prime example, the benefit from being inside the single market without facing the global tariff regime is minimal. Frankly, compared with currency swings, the tariffs into the EU in aggregate is a rounding error.â€¢ Further, it is a fallacy that one needs to be inside the Single Market to trade with it. US, China, Japan and Australia all enjoy access so long as they meet the single market regulatory standards, just as the UK can trade with China so long as Chinese standards are met for its local market.â€¢ On the other side of the coin the Single market remains the worldâ€™s growth laggard, is highly regulated and inflexible. It advantages trade in goods over services. The outcome is a large deficit while the UK enjoys a surplus with the rest of the world.â€¢ The US is the worldâ€™s largest market, with a GDP of $17,947bn, compared with the EU ex UK GDP of $13,381bn. The UK does not have to be â€œinsideâ€ the US to trade there, why then should the UK have to be â€œinsideâ€ the EUâ€™s single market to trade with it?â€¢ The key lesson is the UK does well with the world and very badly with the place the UK is currently tied to â€“ the EU â€“ and remaining in the Single Market will not improve this deficit. On the contrary it may make matters worse as the UK will be required to incorporate continuing EU single market related regulation into domestic law without any say in its framing.â€¢ If the UK remains tied to the EU single market regulatory regime it will continue to pull our political and economic focus towards the worldâ€™s least successful economic zone while tying us down with needless and expensive regulation for all businesses, even if they do not export. The UK has also been paying large membership fees for access into this failing market while other countries such as the US have not â€“ continuing financial contributions will likely be demanded as the price for a bad deal.â€¢ The EUâ€™s record on reaching Free Trade Agreements is very poor, with countries such as Switzerland and Chile having struck more deals and of higher value than the EU and the EU having no FTAs with the leading economies of US, Japan and China. This problem arises because the EUâ€™s 27 members have been slow to reach agreement, with each having their own peccadillos they want resolved. A single country, such as the UK will be able to achieve more FTAs and more quickly than the EU can.â€¢ It is in the EUâ€™s interests to agree a zero tariff deal with the UK simply because they sell more to the UK than the UK sells to the EU. However if they refuse to do so within reasonable timeframe, the UK should leave the EU without a formal agreement, after Article 50 has been triggered, relying on WTO rules and striking free trade deals with our global partners. This stance would be far better than remaining in the failing Single Market, having left the EU, which would be worse than the current arrangements, unsatisfactory as they are. This is because the UK would swap a current marginal influence on Single Market regulation (12% vote in the council of ministers) for no say in regulatory framework at all â€“ while having to accept free movement of people.â€¢ To remain in the Single Market, having left the EU, is the â€˜no say, low growth, regulatory burden, sovereignty illusionâ€™ option locking in perpetual trade deficits. That is why no deal, is better than a bad deal.",NA,NA,5w10su,3.54E-18,-1,Against,25-02-17

15144,5,smidsmi,"Where exactly is your source on this?Actually, I'd prefer to identify myself as someone who wants society to be balanced. I think that manufacturing, agriculture, science, technology, culture, and consumerism should be ubiquitous, not divided up and thrust upon different corners of the world. Globalisation is not equal. Some countries are rich consumers, others are poor producers, and it's not right. It makes me feel like we live in Trantor, the centre of the galaxy, yet the most vulnerable.You disagree? To which point, that the EU does nothing to help? Care to back that up? The EU is not the scapegoat, this is not about blame, this is about change. It is about getting out of this Einsteinian cycle of madness.I think also, looking at it from a neutral pov, people with nothing have no real power. They ask their MPs to help but their MPs do what is in their best judgement, not their constituents best interests, and central government plays the macro rather than the micro. So then you have this once-in-a-life opportunity to make a difference, to have your say, to pull the rug out from under the people who have forgotten you.Can you blame people for taking it? While sit in our nice houses, having enjoyable lives, they live in squalid conditions with black mold in their children's bedrooms, working for Â£6 or Â£7 an hour. Â£7 for an entire hour....that's less than 5% of what I would expect!I cannot blame them for doing what they have done.No, it didn't, but A implies B does not imply B implies A. I'm a Euroskeptic, but I'm also a skeptic of foreign intervention too. Honestly, I don't think we're capable of it. I think that there is too much pollution, societally speaking. I think there are too many factors pulling things in too many directions, such that implementing any kind of unified system properly is impossible. I don't think that the UK post-Brexit should isolate itself from the world, on the contrary, I think we should embrace the entire world. I think the original ideas behind a federated Europe are noble, but I think it has become a corporate circlejerk that no longer serves it's original higher purpose.I would like to see a unified Earth, with uniformly distributed race and culture, but I don't think humans are truly capable of that, because they are so filled with hate and greed.I think the only way that we can achieve some sort of acceptable society is to reduce the number of constraints, downsize if you will. I think there are scales at which it all falls apart.Take for example, communism. On a local level, perhaps even regional, communism can work fantastically. Imagine it, everyone is happy, everyone is helping out, you're all working together towards the common good. But now try that on a national scale, or international, and it falls apart due to common human weakness.I think we have to be realistic. The current system is not working. I know that is one point we can agree on, regardless of our political differences. Whether Brexit is the right decision or not, I don't know, I picked a side based on my beliefs and I will do example what I would have done if the remain vote won: I'm going to work hard for my family, my nation, my fellow human, and for this wonderful planet. I'll do what I can before my ticket is up, and that's all I can do.I hope it works out. I hope that we can find a solution our shared dilemma. I just don't know if we can do it. I don't know if we can shelve our greed.

These are all code words of modern day racism, we aren't stupid. The Leave campaigns rhetoric is full of it.Cycle of madness? Man is it really so bad? What is seriously bothering you about this EU? Is it its laws on human rights? The environment? Labor rights? What is bothering you? You act like it is some demonic organization.This is not because of the EU man. The EU is the reason people in the UK are working for 6 or 7 pounds an hour? It's the UK's own government man. Why are countries like Sweden, Finland, successful in the EU? Germany, Austria, Denmark? These are all successful yet the UK you claim has all these problems. Could it be because the UK itself made stupid decisions. The EU made the UK go to war in Iraq? The EU is making Tory's cut taxes for the wealthiest while people are struggling in the UK? The EU did this?If there is pollution, it is because of people like you polluting the political climate with these ideas and scapegoating not based on facts.Many people have said humans aren't capable of this and that. If you would truly like to see a unified Earth then WORK TOWARDS IT, instead of just regressing. I don't agree with this at all, and you bringing communism in the debate as a comparison to the EU is disingenuous. There has never been a successful communist state. Also many of its ideas are very strange and radical. I know that is one point we can agree on, regardless of our political differences.Yes, that's YOUR SYSTEM. Change YOUR SYSTEM. The UK fiscal policy is responsible for this misery, not the EU. The EU doesn't force Tories to cut taxes for the wealthy while the poor and middle class suffer. The EU doesn't force the UK to embark on military adventures abroad. Look at the logic in what the Leave side is saying today. They are saying lets LEAVE the EU and have less immigration from the EU. Then at the very same time they are saying don't worry we'll make up for it by having immigration from the Commonwealth and USA lol. How can it be that certain countries are successful in the EU and some aren't? Could it be because some countries are simply not as well run themselves? It's like the USA, certain states are successful, certain states aren't. For example Alabama is a poor conservative state which basically is subsidized by wealthy liberal states like California and New York. Is it California and New York's fault or Alabama's fault? All these problems the UK is having regarding the middle class and such. Does the USA not have these very same problems? Does Canada not have these same problems? Does Argentina not have these same problems? Does Turkey not have these same problems? Does Russia not have these problems? Brazil?All the problems you are talking about have nothing to do with the EU. They are happening regardless of the EU, so the fact that you think leaving would remedy these issues is unbelievable. Also the UK is one of the best places to be in. I disagree with this terrible picture you paint of the UK in the EU. Are there winners and losers like with everything in life?

If there is one thing that the 27 agree on it is that immigration from outside the EU should be dealt with at national level. The Commission also does not have the right to act on matters of external competence unless instructed by the Council, and the Vouncul does not have the right to decide national foreign policy matters except in the very narrowly defined JHA area for which there is a national veto. Fought and won by the UK ironically.So it is entirely up to each Member State how to treat third country nationals.  With third countries there is no EU harmonised position, nor does a third country have to treat all EU citizens alike. An example: Germans don't need a visa to enter Turkey. Brits do. Germany has different rules on how to treat US citizens than France. Immigration of third country citizens is in no way harmonised by the EU. So the UK better stay friends with Spain.

Every nation has it's own unique immigration situation. You can't compare a former colonial power like the UK with Finland or Norway. First of all, Norway has only relatively recently started to become known as a successful nation. UK is the inheritor of the former British Empire, and it is THE leading member of the Commonwealth. That's why UK has so many Pakistanis, Indians, Bangladeshi's, Nepali's, etc. and the rest of Europe has very few of these. 90% of the UK immigration ""problems"" are of there own making. The immigrants people in the UK are most worried about will not be affected by the EU status disappearing. Indians, Pakistani's did not immigrate to the UK because of EU immigration policies, they did because of the UK's own unique policy ( UK had a special immigration policy, separate from rest of EU ) However, definitely you will see more Europeans leaving and less Europeans coming to the UK.

15447,5,Vermino,"It might be me as a non-native speaker, but discrimination sounds negative.  So I'm assuming you're of the idea that freedom of movement within the EU is something bad.  As per your own explanation - gaining workforces outside of a nation can be a hasstle.  Most modern nations have a working visa which can be obtained with some effort.  By allowing other nations from the EU to move freely, you didn't make it 'harder' for other nations.  The system to allow indian doctors to come over is still in place.  Obviously, a German doctor with the same skillset has an advantage.  As he can freely move around where his skills are needed most.  But again, this is no disadvantage.  The indian doctor still has the same way of applying for the job, ie a work visa.  he is available if this is really required.  So no, it's not discrimination.  It's a benefit for the EU members.  As for your crop picker stance.  Either there's a need for a crop picker.  Local crop pickers do not wish to fill that position, but a Bulgarian does, and is even willing to travel for it. Or there is no need for a crop picker.  In which case the Bulgarian isn't going to travel 100's of Km's.  So what you're saying is, crop pickers from Bulgaria you don't WANT.

Farmers actually make more from these ""handouts"" than they do from selling crops. If you take away the subsidy the opportunity cost of using land to farm becomes too great and land owners will use it for other uses(solar farms, sell for development etc) reducing the quantity of crops produced. This also raises domesticated prices for food as the supply of crops is restricted.In all honesty I'd rather we let the markets do their job and not subsidise farming but the issue then becomes relying on other nations to meet the majority of our food needs and also losing the industrial farming knowledge we might need in the future.

So we don't have full control of our borders.That doesn't make sense. People don't tend hold views that they think are wrong. Their views are perfectly justified in their own minds, so it doesn't make sense that they would want to hide the views that they think are right.Yeah it's not a stretch to say that people saying shut the border could have racist motivations. But it is a stretch to say that most of the people who want to close the borders are also therefore racist, and not in fact just want to control themWhat you saying is that 49% of the 50% (thus about 25% of the country - you disagree with this you actually think its more) who voted to leave are racist.

Also, your point fails in that this 25% of people you so nicely pointed out might not participate in the regular political process and took this opportunity during this referendum to make a stand. It doesn't mean that just because 25% of the nation has racist beliefs that the BNP, etc. would do well. It's possible that this segment of people normally doesn't participate in politics and only did so during the referendum. Imposing? Britain was free to join, and they are free to leave as they are doing now. News flash nations need to trade under a common set of rules and regulations. Also you say the EU was just about trade back in the 70s. What are you talking about? There was no EU in the 70's. It had developed over time, and quite recently actually, within the last 30 years. So it's fine, no problem. UK up till now was part of it, and now wants to leave. No problem, you have this right, you can leave. It is not tyrannical, you have the option of leaving. We can draw reasonable conclusions on the future based on information we have today and based on history. No emotions here. UK airlines were all against leaving. Most financial services in the UK were against leaving. Most of academia/universities was against leaving. Why do you think that is? UK hasn't even triggered article 50 after 9 freaking months because they are afraid. The pound is constantly falling even before they trigger it. These are all positive signs? Since you told me something I CAN'T do, I'll tell you something you can't do. You can't go back to the Britain of the 1950s, 60s, 70s. That Britain is dead and it will never come back, get used to it, adapt. The world is changing at an exponential rate, and Britain must change with it or be left behind. Yes it is. The rest of the world is indeed full of nice people who will play fair. It also has it's share of terrible people. UK should integrate with those people that have shared values and interests. UK already was looking after it's own interests firsts. Remember when UK decided to invade Iraq alongside the US? Did EU intervene and force UK not to? Of course not. This is an illusion.

Please share this as much as possible. Please ask your MP to vote for the Lords amendments to the Brexit bill.We need a soft Brexit. Here is why and how we might be able to achieve it:I've been watching the news and following the ping pong of the Brexit bill from the Lords back to the Commons. The Lords made some very valid points about ensuring the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. The Commons will vote tomorrow on the amendments and if the government wins then you can expect article 50 to be triggered within a week or so without any guarantee of the rights of UK citizens in the EU or vice versa. Either way it will certainly be triggered by the end of the month.Please ask your MP to vote for the amendments to the Brexit bill. This will ensure rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. The vote is tomorrow so there is time to send an email. Full list of contacts here: http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/This is the really important bit. It will also mean there is a better chance of the government getting a good deal as it will give the UK the moral high ground on entering the discussions. The government will be able to say that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK are protected. That is a pretty good way to open a friendly negotiation right??Once the clock is ticking then the government has 2 years to make a deal. If there is no deal the UK will crash out of the EU and onto WTO rules. Hard Brexit. If the government makes a hash of the deal and presents some really crappy terms to parliament at the end of the 2 years then parliament will have to reject the deal. Hard Brexit. In the unlikely event that the government gets a good deal from the EU and it passes through Parliament then you might get a Brexit where we still have some protection from the EU in terms of trade and some of the tariffs and rules it imposes to prevent a race to the bottom for its citizens. Soft Brexit. So out of the 3 possible options 2 of them are hard Brexit. Great odds!!!What does this actually mean. What are the WTO principles. From the WTO website:The principles.The trading system should be ... without discrimination â€” a country should not discriminate between its trading partners (giving them equally â€œmost-favoured-nationâ€ or MFN status); and it should not discriminate between its own and foreign products, services or nationals (giving them â€œnational treatmentâ€); freer â€” barriers coming down through negotiation; predictable â€” foreign companies, investors and governments should be confident that trade barriers (including tariffs and non-tariff barriers) should not be raised arbitrarily; tariff rates and market-opening commitments are â€œboundâ€ in the WTO; more competitive â€” discouraging â€œunfairâ€ practices such as export subsidies and dumping products at below cost to gain market share; more beneficial for less developed countries â€” giving them more time to adjust, greater flexibility, and special privileges.Sounds ok but this is basically heading towards a completely free market economy. So what happens in a completely free market economy? Goods and services are moved around the world with no customs charges or tariffs. This will ultimately drive low skilled wages in the UK to the lowest possible level regardless of minimum wage or other social policies because to keep jobs in the UK there will have to be companies operating the absolutely lowest cost to compete.It will be these companies that put pressure on government to remove things that cost additional money like the minimum wage, unemployment benefits, national insurance contributions, universal NHS etc. There are arguments in favour of free trade but the benefits cluster towards those that can take advantage of the situation. Those that have no choice will be participants in a global race to the bottom.

People seem to point at Merkel and her immigration policy on Syria, but that is a German policy, not an EU one. The EU is a capitalist organisation - it exists to drive trade and commerce, and create wealth. The UK has enjoyed enormous financial benefits since becoming a member of the EU (or EEC as was), and continues to enjoy those benefits today. The primary arguments for the UK leaving the EU are socialist ones, but have been hijacked by right-wing politicians who seek popularity among a disillusioned electorate.The second is this idea that the Remain side of the argument are the easily triggered SJWs. I hate this infantile discourse that's creeping in from American politics - snowflakes, SJWs, trigger-warnings, etc - especially, as it seems to have been grasped by those who support Brexit as a club to beat skeptics with.

The greens and the lib dems are irrelevant. 2) The government is quite right that the EU need to be incentivized to give us a good deal - giving parliament a veto on a deal would encourage them to give us a bad deal. 3) By their own admittance, peers in the lords have added this meaningful vote clause purely with the intention of trying to prevent leaving the EU. They make no illusion of that fact. 4) No definition of what 'meaningful' actually entails has actually been given by the opposing parties - at least none that I have seen.

The difficult truth here is that, the UK has tried to resolve this matter already - and 'one or two' of the EU 27 said no. So /u/eliotman is correct in this case, this particular situation could have been resolved if the 27 had wished to, but they did not. As with any vote, not everyone votes the same way. But there was a majority, of over 1 million people, and the voter turnout was higher than any other UK vote in my lifetime. So the result in my eyes is more legitimate than most general elections, and no one called for them to be counted as not valid. Had the vote gone the other way, the leave voters would have had the same answers given to them if they kept 'moaning'. Outside of reddit, in the real world, I have not experienced any of the hatred and vitriol that many refer to.

Following her rise to PM, and in the wake of a very divisive referendum, there were four basic strategies available to her. Instinctively, I would have ranked them in this order, with the top option being the preferable option.1. Seek to placate both sides of the argument by acknowledging the vote to leave as a mandate, but with strong policies in place to protect those areas remain voters are most worried about - NHS, education, HE, workers rights, environment, etc. Make the case for as soft a Brexit as possible to protect the economy.2. Throw your hat in with the leavers. They won the referendum, and will likely decide the winner of the next general election. Go hard, go fast, address their biggest concerns like immigration and job creation as quickly as possible.3. Block the referendum, and go hard on remain. Protect the economy, and all the benefits we get from EU membership. Make it clear that the EU has been scapegoated, and seek to address the problems that have been caused by decades of bad UK policy, which have been blamed on European migrants.4. Piss everybody off. Pretend that 48% of the population and anybody under the age of 18 don't exist, but be as unclear as possible about the terms of negotiation with the EU to ensure that the 52% have no idea what the country will look like post-EU. Stretch that uncertainty out for as long as possible to damage the Â£, and insult our European partners as often as possible to ensure the negotiations are long, strained, and probably don't yield anything close to the desired results.At the very first meeting of the new government, I would have been saying that the only requirement, the ONLY requirement, is that we don't pick number 4.",dey85xi,dexh2rr,5zdv4f,1.72E-07,-0.999999657,Against,15-03-17

15857,5,amgiecorker,"Brexit: Evil caused by those who do nothing **Summary of conclusions from this thread:  If it is a problem doing nothing, how do we do something? **I've done my best to reach Rational conclusions  and it seems likely these two items/actions would help: The first is easy for all of us (concerned about the quality of debate) whether we voted leave or remain. __Those of us who are better informed (Digitally literate, consumers of a variety of news/fact sources) should be  - now and then - gently correcting a specific mis-facts espoused by anyone - be they leave or remain.__Given the emotional nature of debates, this is not about having prolonged exchanges; think more surgical.  It is about noting a point that you don't think is factual; telling the person that it is interesting and you'll explore that point; and having done basic research, then openly sharing your evidenced finding (whether they prove you wrong or right) For example, a leave voter recently was angry at Sturgeon for wanting to break up the Union; my response would be to go check that this likely outcome (the desire to part) was well advertised before the vote, then to tell the person that either it was noted ahead of the vote by x, y and z: or of course 'no, no one thought of this it seems, its a huge surprise' accordingly. Then walk away.  Don't expect them to go ah, ok, I retract my vote; don't pursue any further emotional exchange.  A drip, drip, drip effect of us doing this (this is doing 'something', in a kind way) will gently help people disadvantaged by poor sources of information begin to understand there are many other perspectives and sources.  This would benefit the whole UK irrespective of Brexit.   We can take it further of course; if you know a leave or remain voter dependent on biased press for their info, then you could gently explain that they're only getting one perspective and offer to buy them a subscription to a fact based newspaper or news magazine for a few months if they would be willing to think about other perspectives. __The second is something we all need; a simple graphic showing the evidenced impacts of launching article 50, over the next 10 years, a balanced view showing the negative and positive impacts.__This would be useful for everyone whether they voted leave or remain. We can't necessarily rely on the government to do this (there was minimal mention of Brexit in recent budget, and ""We have made no changes to our policy assumptions regarding Brexit"", OBR, 8th March 2017)But creation of a high level view should be perfectly feasible, for example, I can find good evidence for all of these:We know UK consumers' will effectively have less money (inflation); We know the UK will sell less to the EU (61% reduction in service sales predicted, for example);We know that UK citizen's human rights are very likely to change;We know that austerity will continue (national debt grows); We know we're starting these changes from a bad place (4 million children in poverty; NHS on its knees; large national debt, etc).I would be happy (ecstatic even, in reality) to include many positive impacts of course; just not finding many at the moment. Does anyone know of any such document already?  (simple, evidenced, balanced, neutral)  Or of solid sources of evidence on relevant points?  If so, please do link.  By the power of the Internet, we could probably create such a document, but much better if a few examples already exist.This would be useful for everyone whether they voted leave or remain. If others have similar ideas,  around increasing the quality of information available to everyone, please feel free to share. Original OP follows (mainly just for the record; my opinions about the important points mentioned below, have changed, evolved into the solution above)*****************Strong title, but here's my thinking. Brexit will bring consequences that will harm the most, those in society who have the least and the case for Brexit is utterly flimsy (i.e. vulnerable):*""the will of the people"" is actually just the whim of 37% of voters *Those 37% are (largely, not exclusively) sustained by the lies, exaggerations, and selective fact picking of right wing press*The readers of those papers are among those most likely to vote in elections, so Politicians who previously admitted that Brexit would be a risky gamble with uncertain benefits are pursuing it with vigour in order (I assume) to gain or retain political, or even worse personal, power*Those same politicians and newspapers have been negligently rushing Brexit (using lies, manipulations, attempts to avoid governance) because they know the case, and hence the support, is so flimsy that it will evaporate if they don't keep pressure upSo the movement for Brexit, supported by the minority, must be very vulnerable to simple truth, knowledge and facts (if these virtues can somehow penetrate the broiling emotions and fears stirred up by the aforementioned lies) And those of the 63% of voters who believe Brexit impacts will be destructive, have a duty to try any simple actions that will combat the lies and manipulations.  Question is, what to do?  How to get higher quality information to those addicted to biased info sources? (and fair warning, some of the leave voters will react to effective challenges with anger and denial; trying something might damage relationships)Any ideas welcome*edited for basic maths, 63%",NA,NA,5ztsyr,1.25E-22,-1,Against,16-03-17

Pretty good compared to most general elections, but shameful when you consider it was the country's most important political decision in living memory. Hopefully Brexit will stand as a lesson to non-voters, but it's far too big a price to pay.Evil is a bit strong. Brexit isn't evil, it's stupid. These cynical, self-serving politicians didn't suddenly emerge - they've been making a living in this country for years. We have stupidly handed more power to them out of fear, and a reversion to identity politics.I think you're wrong in saying the Brexit movement is vulnerable to simple truth. The opposite is true - it has been so successful because it is impervious to simple truth. It relies on emotional, not intellectual support. The narrative is so highly charged, people are arming themselves with arguments and statistics with the express purpose of defending their own belief, and attacking those on the opposite side (both sides guilty of this) - it is an argument being had for its own sake, and actually has very little to do with the EU. This sub largely attracts the thinking-man's Brexiteer, but despite what they may say, they are a tiny minority among those who voted Leave, just as those with a good knowledge of the EU and its policies are a minority among Remain voters. This is a fight that has been brewing for decades, and has very little to do with the EU.If you really want to win the long game on this, you have to accept defeat. More people voted for Leave than Remain. You could run another referendum, and maybe next time Remain would win, but you won't solve the problems. A huge chunk of the population are seriously discontent - with their life, with their country, with politics - and they won't stop being so until their problems are addressed. Of course the EU isn't the source of their woes, but they've been the perfect scapegoat for 40 years. Once the EU can no longer soak up this criticism, their ire will turn elsewhere. Leaving the EU will not make these people happier, and there is a very strong argument to suggest it will make their lives much worse.The solution? Focus on things that actually matter to people in their daily lives. Our education system is on the brink of collapse, and the government is doing nothing about it. Where is the concern for millions of children and teenagers who are being punished by years of terrible government policy?If you still believe we can remain in the European Union if we make the right arguments, I don't say you are wrong. I'm saying that in doing so, you'd be paying a cost that isn't worth it.

15880,5,amgiecorker,"Hi.  Useful post thank you. Slightly rushed reply here, but hopefully also useful. High turnout is a good point, but we've still got the majority who didn't want change being led into extremely risky change by the minority who did.  It's simpler than elections - do you want change: yes or no? most said no (actively or passively).Education is critical I agree.  But education would progress faster if we remained in the EU - convergence funding targets economically deprived areas of the UK and has been used for many ambitious educational projects (I've witnessed them in Cornwall and the Welsh Valleys for example), and that funding has the benefit of coming from a stable source (not so prone to changes of government, changes of policy, as national education funding) and the wisdom of the crowd (many countries have input into creating policies). And if we trigger article 50 we trigger years of financial uncertainty, which makes it less likely we will be able to fund improvements. Which are good arguments that we should take action now, if we can identify effective acts, rather than passively waiting.re: emotions, I think you're right again that Brexit is highly emotionally fuelled, but I regard emotions as easier to change than facts or logic: the emotional element to Brexit is Brexit's weakness and is probably why the government is rushing Brexit - they suspect emotions built on a lot of lies and manipulations are not sustainable for ever. The UK can be characterised as irrational, over emotional, exposing itself to silly risks, and when that happens to a person, counselling helps them find new perspectives, identify facts and think more logically. The chasm in the country that you are decently concerned about, closes massively if those who are being manipulated into extreme view points learn there are other perspectives.  So to help the UK act more sensibly, we just need to expose those who are being manipulated, to a more balanced view, different opinions, more facts about what the EU is and what it does (good and bad). question is then, how do we do that?

There could be an argument that labour didn't do enough for the remain side, but I rarely see that get any press.If we are to go down the pointless road of playing crystal ball with the electorate, polls post brexit are suggesting more and more people want to just get on with it and stop all this unnecessary and pointless chatter of something so fundamental as the results itself. I think it's time to move on and the people who are still playing the same old tunes are the ones causing the uncertainty and the economic sting of Brexit.

So I maintain that the majority didn't want change.   I agree, labour have been ineffective. I hadn't thought of people wanting to 'get on with it' ( so thank you for mentioning it).  Because that's crazy - no clear benefit, massive risk, weak mandate. Politicians - the new crowd, with a blank slate - could just have easily said, sorry, too many lies, too small a majority - we will ask parliament what to do (no whip, parliament say 'bad idea', government become more EU positive, issue disappears over time).  They had choices is what I'm saying, unless their ascent to power came with strings.  I do detect apathy though and 'head in the sand' behaviour, which is why I started this thread. Overall, it comes back to an unhealthy relationship between media moguls and politicians: I don't want the UK to be run by our media (I know, Frankfurt school, unfashionable until recently - but look at the evidence in the US, in the UK), especially not sections of the press which have admitted to deliberately manipulating their readers (one of the editors at least, tweeted a claim equivalent to that 'Sun what won it' boast).  all good; gets a closer to an answer to the question I asked in the first place. thankyou.

Politicians' and citizens' interests don't always align, so it was absolutely right to hold a referendum in the first place. Why try to leave an organisation based partially on how democratic it is without doing the most democratic method of voting and hold a referendum? Let's assume you're right for the sake of argument and the majority don't want change. Tough. We had our chance. I voted remain and so did the rest of the 49%. But unlike a lot of people I understand how referendums work and how democracy works. And democracy worked. If we decided to have a re run that'd be setting a dangerous precedent of ""let's play the referendum game until we win because it's more democratic.""

15897,5,SamSchpasm,"Hello mate. Thanks for the reply. Bit of a rant below, apologies in advance...I'm not sure that those who didn't vote were motivated by a desire to stick with the status quo. I think it's more likely that they simply had no idea whether we should be in the EU or not. In that sense, they were probably being a lot more honest than many voters, who cast a vote either for Leave or Remain without having any idea what the EU is/does, or what the impact of either course of action would have.Referenda are dangerous things. I'd prefer that they not be used at all, as there is no way to translate them proportionately - they are by definition binary. If you are going to have a referendum, they should be on moral and cultural questions - should we legalise same-sex marriage? Should we ban smoking in public places? These are simple questions with simple answers. The losers will have to bite their tongues and accept the verdict. Most Leave voters saw the EU referendum as a question like this. They are culturally opposed to the EU, so no amount of poor economic forecasting will change their minds. Would you vote in favour of the UK becoming the 51st state of the US if somebody could make it very clear that GDP and standard of living would rise as a result? It might sound absurd, but that's pretty analogous to what we're asking roughly 50% of the population to choose.If you treat the EU referendum as a practical question, and look at the economics, the politics, the security, then you will almost certainly conclude that we should Remain. It is the logical choice, and I think most Leave voters would acknowledge that. The big difference is that a practical question, which is how most Remain voters took it, can be interpreted in many different ways - there is room for compromise. If you take the referendum as a cultural/moral question, there is no compromise - it is In or Out.It isn't too difficult to see why the EU means such different things to different people. Education is linked, but it isn't the cause - its a lens through which we can see and explain the differences.Somebody who is naturally intelligent, had a good upbringing, had a solid education, made the most of those opportunities, and maybe went on to university and a well-paid job. I've made these assumptions about you based on your previous posts - maybe I'm wrong, but I suspect not. This is certainly the background of most Remain voters. This is a platform from which you have the luxury of looking at the EU and saying ""it isn't perfect, but I understand that the benefits of membership far outweigh the problems."" The people on this platform, and I myself am one, usually look back on their lives with pride - they've done what you're supposed to do, played the game, and have a meaningful, if not positively happy life as a result.But the game is rigged. We have a tendency to think we've adapted to a system and therefore deserve the successes we've gained, and I don't say that we don't, but the system has been created to do precisely that. It sorts children at a very early age into those who are good enough, and those who aren't. Can you imagine what it must be like to be told you aren't clever enough to succeed at 11 years old? I can't.We deliberately divide society into those who matter and those who don't, and the EU referendum has exposed this division. Of course there are intelligent, successful people who voted Leave, but the vote was carried by tapping into the disillusioned. The Leave vote wasn't a vote for hope, it was the cry of the hopeless. It was a cry of ""help us"" and ""fuck you"" in equal measure.The widespread response has been predictably hostile. How dare these uneducated people derail the whole country? How dare they get involved in things they don't understand? Racist, ignorant, selfish proles. We taxpayers fund their NHS, we fund their education, we donate to charity, and set up food banks. What more do they want?They want to be like you. They want to live in a country that gives them opportunities, and hope. Since childhood, they've been told they're not good enough to matter. The few institutions that are meaningful to them have been stripped away too, because they too aren't considered good enough. Community cohesion is expensive. Local pubs are expensive. Quality schools are expensive. These tonics have been pulled away over the years, and the poorest communities have been stripped of their identities, because they don't make financial sense.These communities, struggling along, have to watch their wealthy compatriots gush over refugees, gloat about how wonderfully liberal they are as they campaign for women's and LGBT rights, and congratulate themselves on having done so well, and being so good. Though everything else has been stripped away from these communities, they still have their pride, and they will not ask for the help they so desperately need. They just have to watch from the sideline, feeling ghettoised - aliens in their own country.I think this is where the resentment comes from. It isn't about the EU, it isn't about foreigners. It's become about survival. They feel like they're being culturally purged from the UK by what has become known as the ""metropolitan elite"" in the narrative, and this resentment is an absolute goldmine for media outlets like the Daily Mail, and pseudo-political entities like UKIP, who thrive on conflict and hate, as well as peddling it. The EU has been the perfect scapegoat for this anger, and even the Conservative Party has made use of it - decades of soaking up criticism that should really be directed at UK policy has finally reached breaking point. People believe that the EU is the cause of their woes, and have voted accordingly.I believe they are wrong, but it's too late. Repairing this specific situation would result in further long term damage. The only positive solution is to go back to the root cause of this split. It isn't a case of educating people out of their ignorance - it's about building a society that is shared by all. Not everybody is good at maths, not everybody is good at English - if you can't succeed naturally at these two specific disciplines as a child, you're out. How about a system that acknowledges that everybody is good at something, and a school system that seeks to identify a child's strengths, rather than ruthlessly exposing their weaknesses? How about adequately funding local government, and making sure community decisions are made by members of the community? How about genuine credible alternatives to university education?I genuinely believe our society is broken, and all energy should be focussed on fixing it before we do anything else. Yes I wish we could have stayed in the EU while doing it, but it's unlikely anybody would ever have noticed it needed fixing if Remain had won.",df35148,df2ejw9,5ztsyr,0.962135448,0.924270896,Brexit,18-03-17

15914,5,amgiecorker,"Hiya. thank you for replying. No apologies needed for ranting:) Strongly agree remain is only logical choice for the populace.Education - yours is a good treatment of one of the key differences that were indicated between remain/leave. (I read an academic study - Loughborough I think - which found a correlation which supported these impressions) It goes beyond pure schools/universities though.  The Internet is revolutionising education: people can find terabytes of info, videos, communities (forums) to quickly become informed, or expert in a subject - as long as they have basic maths, English, and digital literacy (including critical analysis ability of sources).   As I mention elsewhere, I'm beginning to think the digital divide might be a strong differentiator between leave and remain: the digitally enabled will be aware of a much wider range of opinion (even if some of it is only expressed in emoticons or swear words!).  Seriously though, the internet is many to many communication (frequently) whereas a newspaper is one to many: if the one is relied on, the one gains undue influence.   Which is why the one must be responsible rather than deliberately poisonous and manipulative.  Tony Blair mentioned a further point (his eventual Eulogy may yet need to be revised but ...&lt;snipThat filled in a gap for me; the Brexit project would be canned by any business very early in the lifecycle (too much risk, too little benefit); I thought the government was just stupid and power hungry, but Blair has identified the ideological reason; they are taking silly risks for a chance to implement some free market nirvana that will cause pain, and that might well fail completely. There are moral implications of all this, but I skip to the logical part: it allows us to start filling in gaps on a model of what they will do if we leave.  The impacts are likely to include serious financial stress for years on the economy (financial services and consumer spending are important pillars which are both going to be disturbed); risk (I don't know how likely) of UK and global recession again; more expensive goods - less money in the pocket; reduced human rights for UK citizens; likely reduced employment rights - I could easily see pressure on reducing holiday allowance for example - bear in mind these are the Tories so they will deregulate; the final death rattle of unions maybe; more zero hours work; even less company taxation (so less tax revenue all round, hence more cuts to public services); increased carbon and other nasty chemical emissions as EU regs are dropped, etc. And because of those type of likely impacts, we can't wait: if we wait then the desirable and intelligent reforms you recommend - the fixing of broken society - will be delayed whilst the UK deals with years of economic fallout.  We are in no position to be exposed to more risk - 4 million UK children in poverty according to the Guardian, government wanting to cut schools budgets, and hell-bent on exposing us all to years of instability.  We (those who have the benefits from education you describe, and the digital literacy) have to try to identify positive actions now; if we can identify them, then we have to enact them.  looks - so far, very high level - like those actions would include modelling (or ideally reporting on modelling of) impacts of brexit on individuals; and communicating them over unbiased channels.

However, these people are the most influential in our society because they are exposed to a limited agenda, which makes it easier to motivate them to vote (""immigration is bad for us, so I voted leave"") whereas the rest of us, with broader sources, find it harder to reach clear conclusions, and are not fired up to vote: we don't have the repeated exposure to simple biased messages which have a persuasive effect. these people become convinced that they are right, and must express it in the booth.  so the limited info people vote more than those who have broader grasp of issues.  we can't ignore them, else they bias the way this country is run: our country takes genuinely stupid decisions (effectively).   The referendum is an absolutely spectacular example of these people shooting them selves in the foot as well (GDP doing ok compared to the rest of the EU, but they trigger more guaranteed economic decline/increased debt for the next 5? 10? years which will impact them the most). All of this is why those of us with broader perspectives are continually surprised by election and referendum results which seem incompatible with realities.  the Tory party needs then to follow the wishes of their fairly limited understanding supporters - certainly in Brexit - else the Tory party tears itself apart. a clumsy explanation maybe, and of course there are many other factors, but the essence of that makes me believe we must prick the bubble that surrounds these limited agenda people (we all have similar potential; environment, nurture, and opportunity will impact the opportunities we have, and our willingness to pursue them so we should try to be compassionate really), so that they learn there are different perspectives, and that evidence is important, and they learn to recognise biased sources.   and we must do it gently - sustained arguments don't tend to work I've found, but a repeated pricking of their certainty bubble, expecting no immediate impact, like a dripping tap working through concrete, will have an impact over time.   I'm trying to figure out some ways of contributing significantly to this, but to be effective, many of the broader perspective people will need to adopt similar, gentle, regular, surgical, evidence based corrections. in other words, it's really important that remainers (the more rational side, logical, informed) do not give in to depression and apathy.  Keep (gently) fighting.  It will be difficult to stop leaving process if the Tories recklessly trigger article 50 ( it's still worth fighting it) but I feel the citizens will be obliged to have some further say at some point (via election or referendum) as that referendum was so shoddy - still no one knows what they actually voted for on the leave side - the politicians don't even know yet: our country has to be in better informed shape by then and it is down to all of us to contribute.

They appreciate the variety in food, different countries to work and live in and all the benefits that being in the single market offers. However. One integral issue is under Heath and Wilson they actively persuaded the public that they were joining an economic organisation- what happened? It became political through the treaty of Maastricht, where the term ""federal state"" was scrapped due to Britain thinking it entailed too much of a United States of Europe agenda. However, that is very much the aim of the EU, or rather, the European Project. Under Major The UK pulled out of the EMU=the euro and this was one of the greatest things they have ever done- nonetheless, the Schuman plan was an attempt by the French and German to open up the coal and iron ore industries setup under a supranational entity given sovereign powers, to be open to membership by other countries. This is what would have effectively happened later on down the line, but to a greater extent. Guy Verofstadt (or however you spell his name) was also commented on wanting a United States of Europe and a European army. You may find the article on the express. Essentially, British sovereignty was slowly being eroded until she would have had no recourse but to be pulled along at the same pace as the other member states, towards becoming a federal state of Europe, much as the cantons in Switzerland, or even the states in the Americas. Lastly, the Eu is entirely too bureaucratic, with all member states being required to agree unanimously on an issue to get anything done.  It's slow, inefficient, and does not provide Britain with any influence whatsoever, particularly if one out of the dozen member states issues a veto. Sorry for format, it's 5am, going to sleep now.

Lecture by Martin Wolf, Chief economics commentator from the Financial Times. Given whilst Trump was running for office to a US audience. It is Clear that brexit campaign never worked out what it wanted to do; the government hasn't worked out what it wants to do; and nobody knows what is going to happen. (my note: the leave voters could not know the consequences of their vote; makes it critical that the public has another chance to vote - democratically wise - when consequences are known)The two years from article 50 are about more technical/logistical things; trade agreements almost certainly won't be agreed in that time - it took Canada 7 years to negotiate a simpler agreement - and  at the end we will leave, but we won't have trade agreements in place for 5-10 years. (unless we go WTO, but big businesses in UK do not want that).  this time scale makes a 2nd referendum difficult because we won't know the consequences before we've already leftThe UK will then have to decide on our regulatory frameworks for everything - economy, environment, etc.  Years of work need resourcing by the UK. It is 'overwhelmingly probable that over these 5-10 years, [the economic] implications are going to be negative"".  (my note, see the title of this email for his simpler summary of our situation)The UK's bridge role, between global and EU organisations (political and economical) will end. (my note, ironically some of the last vestiges of global status gleaned from having an empire are disappearing here). Countries like the US will have to find other partners inside EU.  Businesses who would have come to UK from the US and Japan and such, will now look to locate inside Europe. Some of our financial sector will definitely move (to Frankfurt, Dublin, Netherlands, etc) (they are not the jewel in our crown they once were, but (my note) they are still 10% of our economy, for now)The UK becomes some sort of large free trade centre (like Singapore or Hong Kong) but it's not clear how that will work out. Tory government knows all this of course, but are pursuing it because if they didn't, the Tory party would very likely split.  If the country decided to stop the article 50 during the two years, we could say we've changed our minds and want to stay (it seems) but (my note, I assume the Tory gov would simply not allow this)or, in simpler language, he says ""I think we're screwed""(my note, so we have to keep trying to share evidence, so limited agenda people get a broader view)",NA,NA,60z4oz,6.88E-11,-1,Against,23-03-17

It's such a seamless feature of travelling between the UK and Ireland that most citizens of each state wouldn't know its official name. It's undoubtedly contributed to a common assertion amongst British people that Ireland isn't really a foreign country; you've never needed a passport to enter and the only reason people bring them is as ID for an airline.But since we're staying and Britain is leaving, a new solution may be needed; or things could remain the same. Given the sensitivity around marking the Irish border (""Welcome to Northern Ireland"" signs erected a few years ago were vandalised and removed within days), never mind enforcing any kind of customs posts there, my suspicion is that a solution to UK-Ireland relations will involve the island of Ireland being designated a special commercial zone where goods and services can be traded freely as they are now - so long as their final destination is the UK or Ireland. In other words, Irish dairies could sell Irish-sourced milk to the UK and UK chains could sell British goods in their Irish stores with no tariffs but not elsewhere in the EU i.e. Tesco could stock Irish Tesco stores with UK goods without tariffs but not Hungarian Tesco stores. The EU won't want to handicap a member state by cutting it off from one of its biggest trading partners and the overall difference it'll make to EU GDP will be tiny.

Just over 9 moths since nearly 52% of Britons voted to leave the European Union, we are now just one day away from the start of negotiations that will take Britain out of the EU. But how will 'Brexit' affect education, especially as younger people (18-24) had the highest percentage of those voting remain in their age category - 73%.  Cost of tuition fees:Over the past few years there have been an increasing amount of UK students studying abroad in other EU countries to avoid the UK's University fees of around Â£9000. European Union law makes this possible for all EU students, so separation could make it significantly harder for British students to afford University, but also for EU students to study in the UK.Erasmus:The student exchange programme funded by the European Union has helped over 200,000 British students study for their degree abroad and benefit from overseas opportunities. This has pushed integration and the embracing of foreign culture to its peak. It is uncertain what will happen to the programme when Britain leaves, but experts are concerned that Britain could be completely excluded but stress students currently involved in the scheme will be unaffected. A positive impact?It is true that the UK's universities are of world class, and a new points-based-system will make it easier for the world class talent from around the world to gain access to these universities, which will reflect positively on the economy. Similarly, there will be and are similar schemes to Erasmus that will help students study abroad in Asia and America which will help students gain and international experience outside of the UK.",NA,NA,622aje,1.68E-10,-1,Against,28-03-17

16360,5,amgiecorker,"these are good comments thank you. If we had all engaged like you then we probably wouldn't be in this - my belief - precarious situation.  Here's my understanding on the points raised.1. there will be significant negative drivers on the economy, magnified as soon as we launch article 50 (yes, we really mean to leave) and sustained increments of negativity until we reach trade agreements (we can't agree trade with others, until we leave; but we need our ~50% exports to EU to be hassle free, so we can't just bail, so this negative impact might last 7 years easily (the Canada deal time frame) or more) - joining the EU was painful for some; leaving it will be painful - I'm not an economist at all, just a rational realist: it seems logical that we can't expose an economy to the clear array of negative impacts without it contracting and that our exposure may be prolonged (or we crash). 2. I've not read article 50 recently, but that seems an optimistic reading to me (our historic commitments becoming void). I suspect it means all trade agreements cease (the cliff edge for the UK) going forward, at that point.  The EU does have an interest in us remaining though for sure; but the impacts of leaving badly would necessarily affect the 1 more than the 27. 3. I believe in the wisdom of crowds. Our current government was appointed by the right wing newspapers and is citing democracy (but not practising it) as an excuse for rushing their own far right vision at huge risk to those who they are supposed to be representing.  Our opposition has been weak (that may be improving).  These sorts of outlying factors are likely to be diluted when a body of 28 make decisions ( as opposed to just one) leading to wiser decisions and more sustained commitments to actions.

16372,5,Sirnails,"By ALAN JOHNSONMARCH 28, 2017LONDON â€” On Wednesday, Britainâ€™s prime minister, Theresa May, is to deliver a letter to the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, informing him that after 44 years of membership, her nation is leaving the European Union. Approximately two years later, after negotiating the terms of that departure, the union will lose at a stroke â€œan eighth of its population, a sixth of its G.D.P., half its nuclear-arms cache and a seat on the U.N. Security Council,â€ as Susan Watkins, the editor of New Left Review, noted recently.Ms. Watkins is a â€œLexiteer,â€ as left-wing supporters of â€˜Brexitâ€™ like me are known. We were hardly a significant force among the 52 percent of Britons who voted to leave in the referendum of June 23. But we were an influence. A counterweight to the anti-immigrant fear mongering of the former leader of the right-wing U.K. Independence Party, Nigel Farage, Lexiteers argued a left-wing, democratic and internationalist case for Brexit. The position was expressed crisply by Perry Anderson, the former longtime editor of New Left Review: â€œThe E.U. is now widely seen for what it has become: an oligarchic structure, riddled with corruption, built on a denial of any sort of popular sovereignty, enforcing a bitter economic regime of privilege for the few and duress for the many.â€Although Lexiteers have little patience for the national nihilism of â€œDavos Man,â€ the globalist elite, we are no xenophobes. We voted Leave because we believe it is essential to preserve the two things we value most: a democratic political system and a social-democratic society. We fear that the European Unionâ€™s authoritarian project of neoliberal integration is a breeding ground for the far right. By sealing off so much policy, including the imposition of long-term austerity measures and mass immigration, from the democratic process, the union has broken the contract between mainstream national politicians and their voters. This has opened the door to right-wing populists who claim to represent â€œthe people,â€ already angry at austerity, against the immigrant.It was the free-market economist Friedrich Hayek, the intellectual architect of neoliberalism, who called in 1939 for â€œinterstate federalismâ€ in Europe to prevent voters from using democracy to interfere with the operation of the free market. Simply put, as Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission (the unionâ€™s executive body), did: â€œThere can be no democratic choice against the European treaties.â€The unionâ€™s structures and treaties are designed accordingly. The European Commission is appointed, not elected, and it is proudly unaccountable to any electorate. â€œWe donâ€™t change our position according to electionsâ€ was how the commissionâ€™s vice president Jyrki Katainen greeted the victory of the anti-austerity party Syriza in Greece in 2015.The European Parliament is not a real parliament. It is not a legislature; its deputies neither offer manifestoes nor carry out the ideas they propose to voters. Elections in improbably large constituencies, with pitifully low turnouts, change nothing. As a Parliament staff member said at the European Research Seminar at the London School of Economics, â€œThe only people who listen to M.E.P.s are the interpreters,â€ referring to the members of the Parliament.The European Council, an intergovernmental body where decisive legislative power actually lies, especially for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, comprises member countriesâ€™ heads of state, who generally meet just four times a year. They are not directly elected by the inhabitants of the nations whose fate they decide. As for the union principle of â€œsubsidiarity,â€ a supposed preference for decentralized governance, it is ignored in all practical matters.The wishes of electorates are regularly brushed aside. When, in 2005, a proposed European Constitution was rejected by voters in France and the Netherlands (most governments did not even allow a vote), this meant nothing to the proponents of the European Project. A few cosmetic tweaks, and the constitution was imposed anyway; only then, it was called the Lisbon Treaty. (Ireland, the only state to allow a referendum on the treaty, voted against it. So Ireland was told to vote again until it got it right. Thatâ€™s democracy, European Union-style.)Whatever the union could have been, since the 1980s it has made neoliberal economics an integral part of the project. By doing so, the union transformed itself into what the German sociologist Wolfgang Streeck has called â€œa powerful engine of liberalization in the service of a deep economistic restructuring of social life.â€ The single market, the Maastricht Treaty, the single currency and the Stability and Growth Pact combined to impose policies of deregulation, privatization, anti-labor rules, regressive tax regimes, cuts to welfare and financialization, and put them beyond the will of the people.Noting that the tools of Keynesian economics, upon which social democracy relies, are now illegal in Europe, even The Economist got queasy, writing that this arrangement â€œfeels politically very dodgy.â€ As for the European Union-United States trade deal, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, it reads like Hayekâ€™s midcentury fantasy come to life, potentially empowering corporations to sue elected governments for daring to listen to what their electors want.Another key institution of the neoliberal union is the European Central Bank. Unelected and unaccountable, the bankâ€™s governors are committed by treaty to favor deflation over growth, to prohibit state aid to stricken industries and to enforce austerity measures. Likewise, the single currency acts as an economic chokehold on entire regions of Europe, which can neither devalue their currency (as sovereign nations can) to become competitive nor grow their way out of stagnation because they are forced by austerity to shrink their economy.The human cost has been grotesque. The European Unionâ€™s economic waterboarding of Greece resulted in a quarter cut from hospital budgets and spending on drugs halved, while rates of H.I.V. infection spiked, cases of major depression doubled, suicide attempts rose by one-third, and the number of stillborn babies rose by 21 percent. Four in 10 Greek children were pushed into poverty, and one survey estimated that 54 percent of Greeks have become undernourished. Philippe Legrain, a former adviser to Manuel Barroso, then the president of the European Commission, observed that as â€œEuropeâ€™s creditor in chiefâ€ Germany â€œhas trampled over values like democracy and national sovereignty and left a vassal state in its wake.â€In extremis, elected national governments are effectively forced out and replaced by compliant technocrats, as George Papandreou of Greece and Silvio Berlusconi of Italy discovered. Sitting atop it all is the European Court of Justice, which issued rulings that the workersâ€™ right to strike was subordinate to employersâ€™ right do business freely. Hayek must be smiling.Though the Leave slogan was mocked, Brexit really was about â€œtaking back control.â€ Democracy needs a demos, a people for whom government is of, by and for. Without one, all you have is inter-elite management, treaty law and money grubbing. But how will â€œthe peopleâ€ be constructed? Politics will decide. A left populism will not seek to define the people as the far right does, in opposition to the immigrant other, but in opposition to those powerful neoliberal elites that are no longer able, as Professor Streeck says, â€œto build a social framework around the hot core of capitalist profit making.â€It has been a colossal error by Davos Man left-wingers to think of nation-states as embarrassing anachronisms hostile to democracy. Far from being a threat to democracy, the nation-state is the only stable underpinning we have yet devised to sustain the commitments, sacrifices and levels of social trust that a democracy and a welfare state require.Right now, the left in Europe is playing by someone elseâ€™s rule book in a rigged game. One part of each nation, the winners, have been â€œusing the globalized world as their extended playing field,â€ as Professor Streeck put it. One, if not the only, meaning of Brexit is that, having lost faith in glib promises of a globalization for all, the other part of the nation â€” the losers, the shutout and the disdained â€” have decided, in desperation, to make a sovereign gesture: to change the rules by returning to nation-state politics in order to have a go at leveling things up. They are â€œseeking refuge,â€ in Professor Streeckâ€™s words, in â€œdemocratic protection, popular rule, local autonomy, collective goods and egalitarian traditions.â€Rather than leave the field to the nativist right, some of us on the democratic left are going with them.",dfjqq67,dfjlszd,61zr8o,1,1,Brexit,29-03-17

If not, they're evil and should be purged no matter the effect they have?  You've merely substituted one master (as you see it) for another - how is that even a victory in any way?  No shackles were broken.  For me, most of the paragraphs are petty remarks.  None of them show any real vision, alternative or grand scheme.  * I vote against because EU enables topics that give my political opponents power/votes.  Seems pretty petty/selfish/sad as an argument.  Especially since it's merely a side effect of grander things - like immigration/refugee policy.  Do you not have any opinion/value on those things, other than 'it gives my opponents votes'?  * The EU isn't directly voted upon / influenced by citizens.  Plenty of other governments aren't, as just discussed.  Having no influence is factually wrong.  Politicians aren't randomly selected or picked by privilege.  Again, not really an argument in my opinion, as the alternative isn't better or much different.  * EU is evil and not looking out for our benefit - see TPP  You can be sure this was put in by corperate America.  Especially given the privacy laws, consumer standardisation requirements and so much more the EU has demanded of large companies.  (Microsoft monopoly case, Power supply standardisation, etc etc).  Are you sure UK is going to have enough leverage vs corperate america by themselves?  * ECB is evil.  Don't have too much knowledge there.  But always hunting for growth/gain has been the reason of plenty of bubbles or market collapses.  Wall street or pure capitalism rarely is for the people.  * But greece!  As I said, how bad would it have been without the EU?  Fingerpointing is easy.  What's the alternative?  Where's the argument it would've been better?  * We're fighting large corperations, we're fighting the power!  Again, seems sad to have to view something like that as a victory.  You won nothing.  someone else still decides your obligations.  a bank still controls the value of your money.   &amp;nbsp;  This isn't a vote for belief or ideals.
